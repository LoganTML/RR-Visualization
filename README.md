 Created an interactive social network of characters in the series Red Rising by Pierce Brown

Struggles:
* Many characters had aliases.  Before processing the data, I converted each character's nicknames / alternate names to something more reliable- e.g. "Darrow, "Reaper", and "Andromedus" all became "darrow-red".  The hyphenation also helped later, when colouring the vertices.
* In the latter half of the series, there were multiple POV characters (it switched every chapter).  When converting from PDF to txt, the chapter names were stripped from the book.  I manually went back and added "POV-(character name)", e.g. "POV-LYRIA", each time the pov switches.
