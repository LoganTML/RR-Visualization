      Once upon a time, a man came from the sky and killed my wife.
Beside him now, I walk on a mountain that floats over our world. Snow
falls. Battlements of white stone and shimmering glass yawn out of the
rock.
      Around us swirls a chaos of greed. All the great Golds of Mars
descend upon the Institute to lay claim to the best and brightest of our year.
Their ships swarm the morning sky, cutting over a world of snow and
smoking castles for Olympus, which I stormed only hours before.
      “Take a last look,” he tells me as we near his shuttle. “All that came
before was but a whisper of our world. When you leave this mountain, all
bonds are broken, all oaths dust. You are not prepared. No one ever is.”
      Across the crowd, I see Cassius with his father and siblings as they
make their way to their shuttle. Their eyes burn at us over the white, and I
remember the sound of his brother’s heart as it beat its last. A rough hand
with bony fingers lays claim to my shoulder, clutching possessively.
      Augustus stares at his enemies.
      “Bellonas do not forgive or forget. They are many. But they cannot
harm you.” His cold eyes peer down at me, his fresh prize. “For you belong
to me, Darrow, and I protect what is mine.”
      As do I.
      For seven hundred years, my people have been enslaved without voice,
without hope. Now I am their sword. And I do not forgive. I do not forget.
So let him lead me onto his shuttle. Let him think he owns me. Let him
welcome me into his house, so I might burn it down.
      But then his daughter takes my hand, and I feel all the lies fall heavy
on my shoulders. They say a kingdom divided against itself cannot stand.
They made no mention of the heart.
PART I
   BOW
Hic sunt leones. “Here be lions.”
    —Nero au Augustus
1
Warlords

      My silence thunders. I stand on the bridge of my starship, arm broken
and held in a gelcast, ion burns still raw on my neck. I’m bloodydamn tired.
My razor coils around my good right arm like a cold metal snake. Before
me, space opens, vast and terrible. Small fragments of light prick the
darkness, and primordial shadows move to block those stars on the fringes
of my vision. Asteroids. They float slowly around my man-of-war, Quietus,
as I search the blackness for my quarry.
      “Win,” my master told me. “Win as my children cannot, and you will
bring honor to the name Augustus. Win at the Academy and you earn
yourself a fleet.” He likes dramatic repetition. It suits most statesmen.
      He’d have me win for him, but I’d win for the Red girl with a dream
bigger than she ever could be. I’d win so that he dies, and her message
burns across the ages. Small order.
      I am twenty. Tall and broad in the shoulders. My uniform, all sable,
now wrinkled. Hair long and eyes Golden, bloodshot. Mustang once said I
have a sharp face, with cheeks and nose seemingly carved from angry
marble. I avoid mirrors myself. Better to forget the mask I wear, the mask
that bears the angled scar of the Golds who rule the worlds from Mercury to
Pluto. I am of the Peerless Scarred. Cruelest and brightest of all humankind.
But I miss the kindest of them. The one who asked me to stay as I bid her
and Mars goodbye on her balcony almost a year ago. Mustang. I gave her a
horse-crested gold ring as a parting gift, and she gave me a razor. Fitting.
      The taste of her tears grows stale in memory. I have not heard from her
since I left Mars. Worse, I have not heard from the Sons of Ares since I won
at Mars’s Institute more than two years ago. Dancer said he would contact
me once I graduated, but I have been cast adrift amongst a sea of Golden
faces.
      This is so far from the future I imagined for myself as a boy. So far
from the future I wanted to make for my people when I let the Sons carve
me. I thought I would change the worlds. What young fool doesn’t? Instead,
I have been swallowed by the machine of this vast empire as it rumbles
inexorably on.
      At the Institute, they trained us to survive and conquer. Here at the
Academy they taught us war. Now they test our fluency. I lead a fleet of
warships against other Golds. We fight with dummy munitions and launch
raiding parties from ship to ship in the way of Gold astral combat. No
reason to break a ship that costs the gross yearly output of twenty cities
when you can send leechCraft packed with Obsidians, Golds, and Grays to
seize her vital organs and make her your prize.
      Amidst lessons of astral combat, our teachers hammered in the maxims
of their race. Only the strong survive. Only the brilliant rule. And then they
left and let us fend for ourselves, jumping asteroid to asteroid, searching for
supplies, bases, hunting our fellow students till only two fleets remain.
      I’m still playing games. This is just the deadliest yet.
      “It’s a trap,” Roque says from my elbow. His hair is long, like mine,
and his face soft as a woman’s and placid as a philosopher’s. Killing in
space is different from killing on land. Roque is a prodigy at it. There’s
poetry to it, he says. Poetry to the motion of the spheres and the ships that
sail between. His face fits with the Blues who crew these vessels—airy men
and women who drift like wayward spirits through the metal halls, all logic
and strict order.
      “But it’s not so elegant a trap as Karnus might think,” he continues.
“He knows we’re eager to end the game, so he will wait on the other side.
Force us into a choke point and release his missiles. Tried and true since the
dawn of time.”
      Roque carefully points to the space between two huge asteroids, a
narrow corridor we must travel if we wish to continue following Karnus’s
wounded ship.
      “Everything’s a damn trap.” Tactus au Rath, rangy and careless,
yawns. He leans his dangerous frame against the viewport and shoots a stim
up his nose from the ring on his finger. He tosses the spent cartridge to the
floor. “Karnus knows he’s lost. He’s just torturing us. Leading us on a little
merry chase so we can’t sleep. The selfish prick.”
      “You’re such a little Pixie, always yapping and whining,” Victra au
Julii sneers from her place against the viewport. Her jagged hair hangs just
past ears pierced with jade. Impetuous and cruel, but neither to a fault, she
disdains makeup in favor of the scars she’s earned through her twenty-seven
years. There are many.
     Her eyes are heavy, deeply set. Her sensual mouth wide, with lips
shaped to purr insults. She looks more like her famous mother than her
younger sister, Antonia; but in her capacity for general mayhem she far
outstrips both.
     “Traps mean nothing,” she declares. “His fleet has been dashed. He
has but one ship. We’ve seven. How about we just bust his mouth?”
     “Darrow has seven,” Roque reminds her.
     “Your pardon?” she asks, annoyed at the correction.
     “Seven of Darrow’s ships remain. You called them ours. They are not
ours. He is Primus.”
     “Pedantic poet strikes again. The point is the same, my goodman.”
     “That we should be rash instead of prudent?” Roque asks.
     “That it is seven against one. It would be embarrassing to let this drag
out any longer. So, let’s squish the Bellona thug like a cockroach with our
sizable boot, fly back to base, take our just rewards from old Augustus, and
go play.” She twists her heel in emphasis.
     “Here, here,” Tactus agrees. “My kingdom for a gram of demonDust.”
     “That your fifth stimshot today, Tactus?” Roque asks.
     “Yes! Thank you for noticing, Mommy dearest! But I grow weary of
this military crank. I believe I desire Pearl clubs and copious amounts of
respectable drugs.”
     “You’re going to burn out.”
     Tactus slaps his thigh. “Live fast. Die young. While you’re a boring
old raisin, I’ll be a glorious memory of finer times and flashier days.”
     Roque shakes his head. “One day, my wayward friend, you’re going to
find someone you love who makes you laugh at the silly person you once
were. You’ll have children. You’ll have an estate. And somehow you’ll
learn there are more important things than drugs and Pinks.”
     “By Jove.” Tactus stares at him in utter horror. “That sounds resolutely
miserable.”
     I peer at the tactical display, ignoring their banter.
     The quarry we chase is Karnus au Bellona, the older brother of my
former friend, Cassius au Bellona, and the boy I killed in the Passage,
Julian au Bellona. Of that curly-haired family, Cassius is the favorite son.
Julian was the kindest. And Karnus? My broken arm stands testament—he’s
the monster they let out of their basement to kill things.
      Since the Institute, my celebrity has grown. So when news reached the
Violet gossip circuit that the ArchGovernor was finally sending me to
further my studies, Karnus au Bellona and a few handpicked cousins were
dispatched by Cassius’s mother to “study” as well. The family wants my
heart on a plate. Quite literally. Only Augustus’s badge holds them back. To
attack me is to attack him.
      In the end, I could give a bloody piss about their vendetta or my
master’s bloodfeud with their house. I want the fleet so I can use it for the
Sons of Ares. What a mess I could cause. I’ve made a study of supply lines,
sensor stations, battlegroups, data hubs—all the pressure points that might
cause the Society to stagger.
      “Darrow …” Roque comes closer. “Guard your hubris. Remember
Pax. Pride kills.”
      “I want it to be a trap,” I tell Roque. “Let Karnus turn and face us.”
      He tilts his head. “You’ve set your own trap for him.”
      “Now, what makes you say that?”
      “You might have told us. I could have—”
      “Karnus falls today, brother. That is the simple fact of the matter.”
      “Of course. I only want to help. You know that.”
      “I know.” I stifle a yawn and let my eyes sweep the bridgepits behind
and below me. Blues of many shades toil there, working the systems that
run my ship. They speak more slowly than any other Color save Obsidian,
favoring digital communication. They are older than I, graduates of the
Midnight School, all. Beyond them, near the back of the bridge, Gray
marines and several Obsidians stand sentinel. I clap Roque on the shoulder.
“It’s time.”
      “Sailors,” I call to the Blues in the pit. “Sharpen your wits. This is the
final nail in the Bellona coffin. We put this bastard into the ether and I
promise the greatest gift in my power to give—a week of solid sleep.
Prime?”
      A few of the Grays near the back of the bridge laugh. The Blues just
rap their knuckles on their instruments. I’d give half my substantial bank
account, compliments of the ArchGovernor, to see one of those pale
airbrains crack a smile.
      “Enough delay,” I announce. “Gunners to positions. Roque, cluster the
destroyers. Victra, attend targeting. Tactus, defense deployment. We’re
ending this now.” I look over at my wispy helmBlue. He stands central in
the pit beneath my command platform amidst fifty others. The snaking
digiTats that mark the Blues’ bald heads and spidery hands glow subtle
shades of cerulean and silver as they sync with the ship’s computers. Their
eyes go distant as optic nerves revert to the digital world. They speak only
out of courtesy to us. “Helmsman, engines to sixty percent.”
      “Aye, dominus.” He glances at the tactical display, a globular holo
floating above his head, voice like a machine. “Mind, the concentration of
metal in the asteroids presents difficulty in assessing spectro readings.
We’re a mite blind. A fleet could hide on the other side of the asteroids.”
      “He doesn’t have a fleet. Into the breech,” I say. The ship’s engines
rumble. I nod to Roque and say, “Hic sunt leones.” The words of our
master, Nero au Augustus, ArchGovernor of Mars, thirteenth of his name.
My warlords echo the phrase.
      Here be lions.
2
The Breech

      On the tactical readout, the six nimble destroyers move around my
remaining man-of-war. Eerie silence from the Blue crew as the functions of
war take over. On the plane through which their minds now drift, words are
slower than icebergs. My lieutenants monitor my fleet. At any other time,
they’d be on their personal destroyers or leading men in leechCraft, but at
the moment of victory, I want my fellows near. Yet even when my
lieutenants stand here at my side, I feel that separation, that deep gulf
between their world and mine.
      “Missile signatures,” says the comBlue. The bridge does not burst into
action. No warning lights panic the crew. No shouts break the stillness.
Blues are icy specimens, raised from birth in communal Sects that teach
them to embrace logic and enact their function with cold efficiency. It’s
often said they’re more computers than men.
      The dark space beyond my viewport blooms fresh with a thick veil of
microexplosions. Our flak bursts in a great screen of dull white clouds.
Incoming missiles explode as the flak bursts detonate the missiles’ payloads
prematurely. One gets through and a destroyer on our far wing ripples from
the simulated nuclear blast. Men would pour from her. Gases would seep
out. Explosions might puncture holes in the metal hull and bring burning
oxygen rupturing forth like blood from a whale, only to be swallowed in a
blink by the black. But this is a wargame, and they do not give us real
nukes. The deadliest weapons here are the students.
      Another ship falls victim as railgun salvos rip through the flak.
      “Darrow …” Victra worries.
      I stand absently thumbing the place Eo’s ring once graced.
      Victra turns to me. “Darrow … he’s chewing us to pieces, if you
haven’t noticed.”
      “Lady has a point, Reap,” Tactus echoes, face glowing blue from the
tactical display. “Whatever you have in store, don’t be shy about it.”
      “Coms, tell Ripper and Talon squadrons to engange the enemy.”
      I watch the tactical display as the squadrons I dispatched a half hour
prior swoop around either side of the asteroids and descend on Karnus’s
flank. From this distance, they are impossible to see with the naked eye, but
they pulse gold on the display.
      “Congratulations, my friend,” Roque whispers before it is even done.
There’s a strange reverence in his voice, any earlier frustration now gone.
“With this, everything will change.” He touches my shoulder. “Everything.”
      I watch my trap close, feeling the imminent victory drain the tension
from my shoulders. The Grays of my bridge take a step forward. Even the
Obsidians lean to watch the displays as Karnus’s ship registers my
squadrons’ signatures. He tries to flee, blasting his engines to escape what’s
coming. But the angles conspire against him. My squadrons loose missiles
before Karnus can deploy a flak screen or bring his own missiles to bear.
Thirty simulated nuclear explosions wrack his last ship. There is no point to
capturing his ship at this point in the game, and so the Blue fighter pilots
relish a little overkill.
      And like that, I have won.
      My bridge erupts with shouts from Grays and the Orange technicians.
The Blues wrap their knuckles vigorously. The Obsidians, at odds with this
hi-tech world, make no sound. My personal valet, Theodora, smiles to her
younger charges at the bridge’s valet station. A former Rose courtesan well
past prime age, she’s heard her fair share of secrets and serves as my social
advisor.
      Across the ship, from engines to kitchens, the victory transmits
through holo screens. This is not just my victory. Each man and woman
shares it in their own way. That is the scheme of the Society. To prosper,
your superior must prosper. As I found a patron in Augustus, so must the
lowColors find their own in me. It breeds a loyalty of necessity to Golds
that the Color system itself cannot create by mere dictation.
      Now my star will rise, and all aboard will rise with it.
      Power and promise are celebrity in this culture. Not long ago, when
the ArchGovernor announced he would sponsor my studies at the Academy,
the HC channels blazed with speculation. Could someone so young,
someone from such a piteous family, win? Look what I did at the Institute. I
broke the game. I conquered the Proctors, killed one and bound the others
like children. But was that a mere flash in the night? Now those prattling
bastards have their answer.
      “Helmsman, set course for the Academy. We’ve laurels to claim,” I
announce to cheers. Laurel. The word itself echoes through my past,
making bitter my mouth. Despite my smile, I feel no great joy at this
victory. Just grim satisfaction.
      One more step, Eo. One more step forward.
      “Praetor Darrow au Andromedus.” Tactus plays with the title. “The
Bellona will shit themselves. I wonder if I can leverage this into a
command, or do you think I must join your fleet? Can never tell.
Gorydamned bureaucracy is so tedious. Coppers to grease. Golds to lobby.
My brothers will want to throw us a party, naturally.” He nudges me. “At a
Brothers Rath party, even you might finally get bedded.”
      “As if he’d touch your friends.” Victra squeezes my hand, fingers
lingering as though she wore a gown instead of armor. “Loath as I am to say
it, Antonia was right about you.”
      I feel Roque flinch, and remember the sound of Antonia cutting Lea’s
throat as she tried to lure me from hiding at the Institute. I had stayed in the
shadows, listening to my small friend fall wetly to the mossy ground.
Roque had loved Lea in his own fast way.
      “I’ve told you before not to mention your sister’s name in our
presence,” I say to Victra, her face souring at the curt dismissal.
      I turn back to Roque.
      “As Praetor, I do believe I have authority to stock my fleet with
personnel of my choosing. Perhaps we should bring back some old faces.
Sevro from Pluto, the Howlers from wherever the hell they got shipped off
to, and maybe … Quinn from Ganymede?”
      Roque flushes in the cheeks at the mention of Quinn’s name.
      Personally, I wish for Sevro the most. Neither of us is particularly
diligent at keeping in touch over the holoNet, especially me, because I
haven’t had access to it since the Academy began. Anyway, all he’s partial
to sending is holograms of uniquely perverted unicorns and video clips of
him reading puns. Pluto, if anything, has made him stranger.
      “Dominus.” The helmBlue’s voice draws me to the display.
      “What’s wrong?” I ask.
      His eyes are glazed. Distant, jacked into the ship’s sensors, seeing the
raw data of the display I stare at. “Not clear, dominus. Sensor distortion.
Ghosting.”
      On the large central display, the asteroids are there in blue. We’re gold.
Enemies red. There should be none left. Yet a red dot throbs there now.
Roque and Victra walk toward it. Roque motions his hand and the data
transfers to his datapad. A smaller holo globe floats in front of him. He
enlarges the image and cycles through analytic filters.
      “Radiation?” Victra hazards. “Debris?”
      “The asteroid’s ore could cause a mirror refraction from our signal,”
Roque says. “Couldn’t be software.… It’s gone.”
      The red dot flickers away, but the tension has spread through the
bridge. All stare at the display. Nothing. There’s no one else out here except
my ships and Karnus’s defeated flagship. Unless …
      Roque turns to me, face drawn, terrified.
      “Flee,” he manages just as the red signal burns back to life.
      “Full power to engines,” I roar. “Thirty degrees plus our midline.”
      “Launch remaining missiles at the surface of the asteroid,” Tactus
commands.
      Too late.
      Victra gasps, and I see with my naked eyes what our instruments
struggled to detect. One shadowed destroyer emerges from a hollow in the
asteroid. A ship I thought we defeated three days ago. Its engines were off
as it lay in wait. Its front half is torn and black from damage. Now its
engines blast at full power. And its trajectory takes it directly toward my
ship.
      It’s going to ram us.
      “Evac suits and pods!” I shout. Someone’s screaming for us to brace
for impact. I rush to the side of the bridge where my command escape pod
is built into the wall. It opens at my word. Tactus, Roque, and Victra sprint
into its confines. I hold back, shouting at the Blues to hurry and unsync. For
all their logic, they’ll die for their ships.
      I range about the bridge, screaming at them to activate their escape
hatch. The helmBlue does, pressing a button that causes a hole to dilate in
the floor of the pit. One by one, they unsync and are sucked down the
gravity tube into their escape pods.
      “Theodora!” I shout, seeing her prying at a young Blue who still
clutches his operations display with white-knuckled fear. “Get in the
gorydamn pod!” She doesn’t listen. Neither does the Blue let go. I start
toward them just as the proximity sensor lets loose one final warning blast.
      All slows.
      Bridge lights throb red.
      I jump for Theodora, wrapping my arms around her.
      And the destroyer hits my man-of-war at her midline.
      Clutching Theodora to my chest, I’m thrown thirty meters across my
bridge, slamming into a metal wall. White pain rips across my left arm
along the seams of the mending break. I’m slapped with darkness. Lights
dance there, first like stars, then as weaving lines of sand disturbed by wind.
      Red light seeps through my eyelids. A gentle hand pulls at my
clothing.
      I open my eyes. I’m wrapped around a dented electrical column as the
ship shudders, groaning like an ancient, dying beast sinking in the deep.
The column trembles violently against my stomach as the destroyer finishes
sheaving through our middle. Gutting us with slow cruelty.
      Someone’s shouting my name. Sound fades back into being.
      Lights bathe the bridge, alternating shades of murderous red. Warning
sirens. The ship’s swan song. Theodora’s delicate old hands pull at me, like
a bird pulling at a fallen statue. I’m bleeding from my forehead. My nose is
broken. I wipe the stinging blood from my eyes and roll onto my back. A
broken display sparks beside me. It has my blood on it. Did it fall on me? A
bar lies beside it, and my eyes drift to Theodora. She pried it off. But she’s
so small. Her hands cup my face.
      “Get up. Dominus, if you want to live, you have to get up.” The old
woman’s hands tremble from fear. “Please, get up.”
      Groaning, I pull myself to my feet. My command escape pod is gone.
In the collision, it must have launched. Either that or they left me behind.
So too has the Blue escape pod jettisoned away. The frightened Blue has
become a stain on a bulkhead. Theodora can’t tear her eyes away from the
sight. Tears make glassy her eyes.
      “There’s another pod in my quarters,” I mutter. Then I see why
Theodora winces. Not from fear, but pain. Her leg is shattered, splayed off
to the side like a length of wet, cracked chalk. They don’t make Pinks to
last this. “I won’t make it, dominus. Go, now.”
      I bend to a knee and throw her over the shoulder of my good arm. She
whimpers horribly as her leg shifts under her. I feel her teeth rattle. And I
run. I run through the broken bridge toward the wound that is killing my
ship, through the bridge level’s hallways into a scene of chaos. People
swarm the main halls, abandoning their posts and functions as they race to
escape pods and the troop carriers in the forward hangar. People who fought
for me—electricians, janitors, soldiers, cooks, valets. They’ll never make it
to safety. Many change course when they see me. They tumble forward,
leaning against me, panicked and crazed in their mania to find safety. They
pull at me, screaming, pleading. I push them off, losing a small part of my
heart as each falls behind. I can’t save them. I can’t. An Orange grabs
Theodora’s good leg and a Gray sergeant hits him in the forehead till he
drops like a stone to the ground.
      “Clear a path,” the thick Gray bellows. She whips her scorcher out of
her tactical holster and shoots it into the air. Another Gray, remembering
himself, or perhaps thinking I’m his ticket out of this deathtrap, joins her in
parting the chaos. Soon two more carve a path at gunpoint.
      With their help, I make it to my suite. The door hisses open at my
DNA’s touch and we move through. The Grays back in after us, training
their scorchers at the thirty desperate souls who ring the entrance. The door
hisses as if to close, but an Obsidian pushes through the crowd and jams
herself into the doorframe, preventing the door from closing. An Orange
joins her. Then a low-ranking Blue. Without hesitation, the Gray sergeant
shoots the Obsidian in the head. Her companions gun down the Blue and
Orange and shove them off the doorframe so it can close. I tear my eyes
away from the blood on the ground to lay Theodora on one of my couches.
      “Dominus, how much room is there in the escape pod?” the Gray
sergeant asks me as I head to the pod’s entry lock. Her hair is buzzed in
military fashion. A tattoo on her tan neck peaks from under her collar. My
hands fly over the control prism, entering the password with a series of
hand motions.
      “Four seats. You get two. Decide amongst yourselves.”
      There’s six of us.
      “Two?” the female sergeant asks coldly.
      “But the Pink’s a slave!” one of the Grays hisses.
      “Not worth shit,” says another.
      “She’s my slave,” I growl. “Do as I say.”
      “Slag that.” Then I feel the silence as much as hear it, and I know one
of them has pulled a gun on me. I turn, slowly. The stocky old Gray is not a
fool. He’s backed out of my reach. I’ve no armor, only my razor. I might be
able to kill him. The others ask what the hell he thinks he’s doing.
      “I’m a free man, dominus. I should get to go,” the Gray says, voice
trembling, “I have a family. It is my right to go.” He looks to his fellows,
bathed in the nasty red of the emergency lights. “She’s just a whore. A
jumped-up whore.”
      “Marcel, put the gun down,” says the dark-skinned corporal. His eyes
are heavy for his friend. “Remember your vows. We’ll draw lots.”
      “It’s not fair! She can’t even have children!”
      “And what would your children think of you now?” I ask.
      Marcel’s eyes fill with tears. The scorcher quivers in his thick hand.
Then a gunshot. His body stiffens and crumples lifelessly to the deck as the
bullet from the sergeant’s scorcher carries through his head to slam into the
metal bulkhead.
      “We do it by rank,” the sergeant says, holstering her weapon.
      Were I still the man Eo knew, I would have stood frozen in horror. But
that man is gone. I mourn his passing every day. Forgetting more and more
of who I was, what dreams I held, what things I loved. The sadness now is
numb. And I carry on despite the shadow it casts over me.
      The escape pod opens, magnetic lock thudding back. The door hisses
upward. I pick Theodora from the couch and strap her into one of the seats.
The straps are too big, made for Golds. Then something deep and horrible
roars in the belly of my ship, half a kilometer away. Our torpedo stores
detonate.
      Gone is the artificial gravity. Gone are the stable walls. It’s an
insidious sensation. Everything spins. I slam into the escape pod’s floor,
ceiling? I don’t know. Pressure vents out of the ship. Someone vomits. I
smell it rather than hear it. I shout at the Grays to get in the pod. Only one
stays behind now, face drawn and quiet, as the sergeant and a corporal pull
themselves into the escape pod. They strap in across from me. I activate the
launch function and salute the Gray who stays behind. He salutes back,
proud and loyal despite the quiet in him as he faces his last moment of life,
eyes distant and thinking of some young love, some path not taken, perhaps
wondering why he was not born Gold.
      Then the door closes and he is gone from my world.
      I’m slammed into my seat as the escape pod shoots away from the
dying ship. Ripping through debris. Then we’re weightless again and
drifting away from trouble as inertial dampeners kick in. Out our viewport I
see my flagship burping plumes of blue and red flame. Processed helium-3,
which powers both ships, ignites near my man-of-war’s engines, causing a
chain-effect explosion that rips the ship apart. Suddenly I realize it wasn’t
debris I felt against my escape pod as I left the ship. It was people. My
crew. Hundreds of lowColors spilled into space.
       The Grays sit opposite me.
       “He had three girls,” the dark-skinned corporal says, shuddering as the
adrenaline fades away. “Two years and he was out with a pension. And you
popped him in the head.”
       “After my report, coward won’t even scrape a death pension,” the
sergeant sneers.
       The corporal blinks at her. “You cold bitch.”
       Their words fade, overcome by the beating of blood in my ears. This is
my fault. I broke the rules at the Institute. I changed the paradigm and
thought they wouldn’t adapt. That they wouldn’t change their strategy for
me.
       And now I have lost so many lives, I may never know the tally.
       More people have died in a blink than during a whole year of the
Institute, their deaths opening a black hole in my stomach.
       Roque and Victra hail me over the coms. They will have tracked my
datapad and know I am safe. I barely hear them. Anger, thick and evil,
swirls inside me, making my hands shake, my heart slam.
       Somehow, Karnus’s ship continues through space after bisecting my
command, damaged but not broken. I stand in my pod, unbuckling the
seat’s restraints. At the far end of the escape pod lies a spitTube with a
preloaded starShell—a mechanized suit meant to make a man a human
torpedo. It’s designed to launch Golds to asteroids or planets, because the
pod wouldn’t survive atmospheric reentry. But I’ll use it for vengeance. I’ll
launch myself onto that Bellona bastard’s bloodydamn bridge.
       Theodora has not yet woken. I’m glad.
       I tell the corporal to help me into the suit. Two minutes later, I’m in the
metal carapace. Takes another two to argue with the computer over the
calculations required for my trajectory to intersect with Karnus’s so that I
can smash through the bridge windows. I’ve never heard of anyone doing
this. Never seen it even attempted. It’s madness. But Karnus will pay.
       I start my own countdown.
       Three … The enemy ship passes arrogantly a hundred kilometers away.
It is like a dark snake with a blue tail, a bridge in place of eyes. Between us,
a hundred escape pods glimmer like rubies cast into the sun. Two … I pray
that I will find the Vale if I do not survive this. One. My controls go dead
and red flashes across my helmet. The Proctors override my computer and
freeze my controls.
      “NO!” I roar, watching Karnus’s ship disappear into the black.
3
Blood and Piss

      Eight hundred and thirty-three men and women. Eight hundred and
thirty-three killed for a game. I wish I never knew the tally. I repeat the
number again and again as I sit in the passenger hold of the rescue ship sent
to ferry me back to the Academy. My lieutenants sit afraid to meet my gaze.
Even Roque leaves me be.
      The instructors disabled my craft before I could launch. They say they
did it to spare me a fool’s mistake. The gambit was rash, stupid, and
unfitting a Gold Praetor. I stared blankly at them as they debriefed me via
holo.
      We reach the Academy in the ebbing day hours of my ship’s time
cycle. The place is a great domed metal port on the fringes of an asteroid
field, ringed with docks for destroyers and men-of-war. Most are filled.
Home to the Academy and mid-sector command, it is one of the hives of
the Society’s military for the midworlds of Mars, Jupiter, and Neptune,
though it does serve other planetary forces when their orbits take them near.
My fellow students will have been watching here in the dormitories. So too
will have many Fleet officials and Peerless who flocked here for the final
weeks of the game for parties and viewing.
      None will mention the cost of life demanded by Karnus’s victory. But
the defeat will set back my mission. The Sons of Ares have spies. They
have hackers and courtesans to steal secrets. What they did not have was a
fleet. Nor will they now.
      No one greets my lieutenants or me at the dock.
      Reds and Browns bustle about to the orders of two Violets and a
Copper, who make preparations for Karnus’s Victory in the grand
antechamber. The blue and silver of House Bellona trim the cavernous
metal halls. The eagle crest of his family covers the walls. They have white
rose petals for him. Red rose petals are reserved for Triumphs, true victories
where Gold blood is shed. The blood of eight hundred thirty-three
lowColors doesn’t count. That’s a clerical issue.
      My lieutenants slept as we traveled back to the Can. I did not. Tactus
and Victra stumble now ahead of me, walking silently as if still wrapped in
slumber. Despite the heaviness in my shoulders, I don’t yearn for sleep.
Regret lies behind my bloodshot eyes. If I sleep, I know I’ll see the faces of
those I left to die in the ship’s hallways. I know I’ll see Eo. I can’t face her
today.
      The Academy smells of antiseptic and flowers. The rose petals sit in
bins off to the side. Ducts above recycle our breaths and purify the air,
making a steady hum. Fluorescents piss pale light down from the ceiling, as
if to remind us that this is not a kind place for children or fantasies. The
light, like the men and women here, is harsh and cold.
      Roque stays at my side as we walk, though his aspect is deathly. I tell
him to get some sleep. He’s earned it.
      “And what have you earned?” he asks. “Not a day of sulking. Not a
day of self-flagellation. Of all the lancers, you are second. Second! Brother,
why not take pride in that?”
      “Not now, Roque.”
      “Come now,” he continues. “It’s not victory that makes a man. It’s his
defeats. You think our ancestors never lost? You don’t need to huff and puff
about this and make yourself one of those Greek clichés. Drop the hubris. It
was just a game.”
      “You think I give a shit about the game?” I wheel on him. “People are
dead.”
      “They chose lives of service to the fleet. They knew the danger and
died for a cause.”
      “What cause?”
      “To keep our Society strong.”
      I stare at him. Could my friend, my kind friend, be so blind? What
choice did these people have? They were conscripted. I shake my head.
“You don’t understand a thing, do you?”
      “Of course I don’t understand. You never let anyone in. Not me. Not
Sevro. Look how you treated Mustang. You drive friends away as though
they were enemies.”
      If he only knew.
      I find the garden abandoned. It sits at the top of the Can, a large
vestibule of glass, earth, and greenery designed as a retreat for fluorescent-
weary soldiers. Stunted trees sway in a simulated breeze. I take off my
shoes, peel off my socks, and sigh as the grass goes between my toes.
      Lamps above the trees make a false sun. I lay beneath them till, with a
groan, I pull myself up toward the small hot spring that lies in the center of
the glade. Bruises, most faded, stain my body like little ponds of blue and
purple ringed with yellowing sands. The water soothes my aches. I’m
thinner than I should be, but strung tight like piano wire. Were my arm not
broken, I’d say I was healthier than at the Institute. Fighting on Academy
bacon and eggs beats the shit out of the half-raw goat meat of that place.
      I find the haemanthus blossom by the side of the pool. It took life
where no water laps. It is indigenous to Mars, like me, so I do not pick it. I
buried Eo in a place like this. Buried her in the fake forest above Lykos
mine, where I last made love to her. We were scrawny, innocent things then.
How could such a frail girl as she have such a spirit, such a dream as
freedom, when so many strong souls toiled and kept their heads down for
fear of looking up?
      I shouted at Roque that I did not care about the defeat. Yet I do, and
there’s guilt for caring about that when so many lives should demand all my
sorrow. But before today, victory made me full, because with every victory,
I’ve come closer to making Eo’s dream real. Now defeat has robbed me of
me that. I failed her today.
      As if knowing my thoughts, my datapad tickles my arm. Augustus
calls. I peel the hair-thin display off and close my eyes.
      His words echo in memory. “Even if you lose, even if you cannot take
the victory for yourself, do not allow a Bellona triumph. Another fleet
under their control will tip the scales of power.”
      So much for that. I float in the water, drifting in and out of sleep till
my finger wrinkle and I grow bored. I am not meant for these quiet
moments. I pull myself from the water to dress. I can’t keep Augustus
waiting for long. Time to face the old lion. Then sleep, maybe. I’ll have to
stand and watch the damn Victory for Karnus, but after that I’ll be away
from this ugly place and headed back to Mars, and maybe Mustang.
      My clothes are gone, as is my razor.
      Then I sense them.
      I hear their military boots behind me. They breathe loudly from
excitement. Four of them, I guess. I pick a stone from the ground. No. I turn
and find seven blocking the one entrance into the garden. All Golds of
House Bellona. All my blood enemies.
      Karnus comes with the Bellona, fresh from his ship. His face is
haggard as mine, his shoulders maybe half again as broad. He towers over
me—an Obsidian in every way but birth and mind. That laughing mouth of
his grins with uncommon intelligence. He rubs a hand over his dimpled
chin, muscled forearms looking like they’re carved from smoothed
riverwood. There’s something terrifying about being in the presence of
someone so large that you can feel the vibrations of their voice in your
bones.
      “Looks like we caught the Augustus fish out of water. ’Lo, Reaper.”
      “Goliath,” I mutter, using his call sign.
      Goliath the breaker. Goliath the son killer. Goliath the savage. Mustang
says he once broke the spine of a fancy Luneborn Gold over his knee after
the brat thought to splash a drink in his face at a Pearl club. His mother then
bribed the Judiciar to let him off with a fine.
      The list of fines he’s paid for murder stretches longer than my arm.
Grays, Pinks, even a Violet. But his true reputation comes from killing
Claudius au Augustus, the ArchGovernor’s favorite son and heir. Mustang’s
brother.
      Karnus’s cousins orbit around him. All Bellona. All born under the
blue and silver sigil of the conquering eagle. Brothers, sisters, cousins to
Cassius. Their hair is curly and thick, faces all beauty. Their influence
stretches across the Society. As does the reputation of their arms.
      One is much older than I, shorter but more powerfully built, like a tree
stump with blond moss covering his head. He is a man in his thirties.
Kellan, I remember now. A full Legate, a knight of the Society. And he
came here with his brothers and cousins for me. Arrogance drips off that
one. He feigns a yawn as he plays these schoolyard games.
      Fear thunders into my chest.
      I find it difficult to breathe. Yet I smile, fingers grazing the datapad’s
com functions behind my back.
      “Seven Bellona,” I chuckle. “What need have you of seven, Karnus?”
      “You had seven ships against my one,” Karnus says. “I’ve come to
continue our game.” He cocks his head. “Did you think it ended with your
ship dying?”
      “The game is over,” I say. “You won.”
      “Did I win, Reaper?” Karnus asks.
      “At the cost of eight hundred and thirty-three people.”
      “Whining because you lost?” asks Cagney. She’s the smallest of his
cousins, a twenty-something lancer to Karnus’s father. She’s the one
cradling my razor, the one Mustang gave me. She swishes it through the air.
“I think I’ll keep this. I don’t think I’ve even heard of you using it. Not that
I judge. Razors are tricky. The perils of an uneducated upbringing, I fear.”
      “Go stick your fist up your cousin,” I sneer. “Must be a reason you
curly-haired shits all look alike.”
      “Must we listen to him bark, Karnus?” Cagney whines.
      “I taught Julian to fish, Reaper,” Kellan, the Legate, says suddenly.
“As a boy, he didn’t like it because he thought it hurt the fish too much.
Thought it was cruel. That’s the boy your master had you kill. That is the
measure of his cruelty. So how big do you feel? How brave do you fashion
yourself?”
      “I did not want to kill him.”
      “Oh, but we want to kill you,” Karnus rumbles. He nods to his cousins.
Two of the Bellona break branches off the trees and toss them to their kin.
They have razors, but apparently, they want to take their time.
      “If you kill me, there will be consequences,” I say, touching my
datapad behind my back. “This is not a sanctioned duel, and I am Peerless. I
am protected by the Compact. This will be murder. The Olympic Knights
will hunt you. Try you. Execute you.”
      “Who said anything of murder?” Karnus asks.
      “You belong to Cassius,” Cagney says. Her foxlike face splits with a
smile.
      “Today, you are protected by Augustus,” Karnus says. “His chosen
boy. To kill you would mean war. But no one goes to war over a little
beating.”
      Cagney favors her left leg. Knee injury. A cousin of hers leans on his
heels. Frightened of me. Big one, Karnus, squares up, meaning he doesn’t
give a piss about whatever damage I can deal. Kellan smiles and stands
relaxed. I hate those sort of men. Hard to judge. I calculate my chances.
Then I remember my broken arm, my injured ribs, and the contusion over
my eye, cut those chances in half.
      I’m scared. They cannot kill me, I cannot kill them. Not here. Not now.
All of us know how this dance will end. But dance we do.
     Karnus snaps his fingers and they rush toward me all at once. I throw
the stone into Cagney’s face. She goes down. I rush at Karnus, howling like
a mad wolf, slipping past his first blow, and rage a flurry of strikes into his
nerve centers, driving my elbow into his right bicep, rupturing tissue. He
rocks back, and I press into him, using his bulk to shield me from the others
and their sticks. I strip a stick away from one of the Bellona cousins,
leveling her with an elbow to her temple. Then I turn, spinning the stick
toward Karnus’s face. But it’s blocked. Something hits the back of my head.
Wood shatters. Splinters dig into the scalp. I don’t stumble. Not until
Karnus hits me so hard with his elbow in my face that a tooth pops out.
     They don’t take turns coming one by one. They surround me and they
punish me with the efficiency of their deadly art, kravat. They aim for
nerves, organs. I manage to stand, hit a few of my assailants. But I’m not
long on my feet. Someone jams their stick into my spin, impacting the
subcostal nerve. I drip down to the ground like melting wax and Karnus
kicks me in the head.
     I bite through half my tongue.
     Warmth fills my mouth.
     The ground is the softest thing I feel.
     Choking on salt.
     Blood and air spray out of my mouth as Karnus puts his foot on my
stomach, then throat. “In the words of Lorn au Arcos, if you must only
wound the man, you better kill his pride.”
     I gurgle for breath.
     Cagney replaces Karnus, sitting on my chest, knees pinning down my
arms. I suck down air. She smiles in my face and looks at my hairline, lips
parted with excitement of dominating another person. She twists my hair
into her grip. Her hot breath smells like spearmint. “What have we here?”
she asks, pulling my datapad from its place on my arm. “Dammit. He hailed
the Augustans. I’d rather not fight that Julii bitch without my armor.”
     “Then stop dawdling,” Karnus growls. “Do it.”
     “Shh,” she whispers as I try to speak, tracing a knife over my lips,
pushing it into my mouth till the brittle metal clacks against my teeth.
“That’s a good little bitch.”
     Roughly, she saws off my hair.
     “Nice and quiet. Good Reaper. Good.”
      Blood stings my eyes as Karnus shoves Cagney off my chest, grabs me
and hoists me off the ground with his left hand. He flexes his right arm,
cursing about his ruined bicep. He can’t pull it back to swing a punch, so
instead he grins toothily at me and head-butts me once in the chest just at
the sternum. My world rocks. There’s a crackle. The sound of twigs over a
fire. I wheeze out bubbling, inhuman sounds. Karnus head-butts me again
and tosses my aching body to the ground.
      I feel warmth splash over me and the smell of piss claw into my
nostrils. They laugh and Karnus breathes into my ear.
      “Mother bid me to tell you: a pauper can never be a prince. Every time
you look in the mirror, remember what we did to you. Remember you
breathe because we let you. Remember your heart will one day be on our
table. Rise so high, in mud you lie.”
4
Fallen

      I stand before my master, but he does not care.
      The office walls are of paneled wood, and on the floor lies an ancient
rug his iron ancestor took from a palace of Earth after the fall of the Indian
Empire, one of the last great nations to stand against Gold. What dread
those natural-born humans must have felt to see the Conquerors falling
from the sky. Man perfected, but bringing chains instead of hope.
      I stand in front of Augustus’s desk, a bare thing of wood and iron, just
before the seven-hundred-year-old bloodstain where the final Indian
emperor had his head parted from his body by a sleek Gold killer.
      Idly, Nero au Augustus strokes the lion that lies beside his desk. They
look like twin statues. Behind them is space. A viewport peers into the
blackness, where the ships of the Scepter Armada lie like giant golems in
terrible slumber. We pass them on the last leg of our three-week voyage
from Mars.
      Augustus peers at his desk as a stream of data runs over the wood.
      It seems so long ago that he took me on a tour of Mars to show me our
domains—from the latfundias where highReds toil over crops to the great
polar reaches where Obsidians live in medieval isolation. He favored me
then, bringing me close, teaching me the things his father taught him. I was
his favorite, second only to Leto. Now he is a stranger, and I, an
embarrassment.
      It’s been two months since the day Karnus beat me at the Academy.
Though my hair has grown back and my broken bones have mended, my
reputation has not. And because of that, my tenure in ArchGovernor
Augustus’s employ is tenuous, at best. My enemies grow by the day. But
these new ones prefer whispers to razors.
      More and more do I believe the Sons of Ares chose the wrong man. I
am not made for the cold war of politics. Not made for subtlety. Hell, I’d
hide a boy in the gut of a horse any day, but I wouldn’t know how to bribe
someone properly if my life depended on it.
      A gentle, warm voice made for half-truths drifts through the
ArchGovernor’s office. “Three refineries. Two nightclubs. And two Gray
police outposts. All bombed since we left Mars. Seven attacks, my liege.
Fifty-nine Gold fatalities.”
      Pliny. Slender as a salamander, with skin as smooth as a Pink’s. The
Politico is no Peerless Scarred, never even went to the Institute. His
glittering eyes peer out from eyelashes that would put peacock plumage to
shame. Muted lipstick coats thin lips. His hair is coiled and scented. His
body thin, but muscular in a pleasing but utterly fascile way beneath a too-
tight embroidered silk tunic. A child could beat the living hell out of this
beautiful kitten of a man. Yet he’s ended families with a rumor here, a joke
there. His power is a different breed. Where I am kinetic energy, he is
potential.
      I’ve heard he’s also responsible for ruining my reputation. Tactus even
hinted that Pliny might have put Karnus up to the violence in the garden, or
at the very least, arranged a holoCam to record my proud moment.
      Beside Pliny stands the fourth man in the room, Leto. He’s a bright
lancer ten years my senior with braided hair and a half-moon grin. He’s also
a poet with the razor, a younger Lorn au Arcos, according to some. It’s
likely he’ll inherit Augustus’s estate instead of the ArchGovernor’s blood
heirs—Mustang and the Jackal. I rather like the man.
      “The Sons of Ares grow too bold,” Augustus mutters.
      “Yes, my liege.” Pliny squints. “If it is indeed they who perpetrate the
acts.”
      “What other ant bites us?”
      “None, that we know of. But there are spiders, ticks, rats in the worlds.
The bombings are crude for Ares, indiscriminate, uncharacteristically
violent. Discontiguous from the pattern of technological sabotage and
propaganda in his profile. Ares is not capricious, so I struggle believing
these acts originate from him.”
      Augustus frowns. “Then what do you suggest?”
      “Perhaps there is another terrorist group, my liege. With eighteen
billion souls on the census, I hardly think one man has a monopoly on
terrorism. Perhaps even a criminal syndicate. I’ve been creating a database I
can share.…”
      Pliny is right. The terror attacks that have plagued Mars and other
planets make little sense. Dancer spoke of justice, not revenge. These
attacks are petty and gruesome—the bombing of barracks, fashion outlets,
bazaars, highColor coffee shops and restaurants. Ares would never condone
them. They draw too many eyes for too little result, daring the Golds to act,
to crush the Sons.
      I’ve sent messages to Dancer via the holoBox. Nothing. Just silence.
Could he be dead? Or has Ares abandoned me for this new strategy of
bombing?
      Pliny yawns. “Perhaps Ares has changed his tactics. He’s a deuced
one.”
      “If Ares is a man,” Leto says.
      “Interesting.” Augustus swivels abruptly. “What makes you think Ares
isn’t a man?”
      “Why do we assume he’s a man? He could be a woman. Could be a
group of individuals for all we know, which would go a long way toward
explaining the discordant nature of these new attacks.” Leto turns to me,
eyes inclusive. “Darrow, what do you think?”
      “Don’t befuddle Darrow with complex questions!” Pliny crows
defensively. “Make it a yes or no so he can understand.” Pliny flashes me
the most pitying of smiles and squeezes my shoulder in sympathy. “Behind
his lepid smiles, he’s an honest, simple beast. You should know that.”
      I stand there and take it.
      He turns away. “In any manner, Leto, you’re forgetting we designed
Red culture to be highly patriarchal. Their identity as a people centers
around the collection of resources to propagate the embryonic terraforming
of Mars. Physically strenuous, grueling tasks performed by men. Tasks we
don’t let their women perform, even if they are capable, pursuant to the
Stratification Protocol. So, you see, it can’t be a woman, because no
roughneck Ruster would follow a man or a woman who has never ridden a
clawDrill.”
      Leto smiles cleverly. “If Ares is a Red.”
      Pliny and Augustus both laugh. “Maybe he’s a deranged Violet who’s
taken his acting to a new stage,” Pliny offers.
      “Or a Copper cambist beleaguered by filing provincial tax returns,”
Leto adds.
      “No! An Obsidian who, dare I say, has finally forsaken his terror of
technology and developed the skills to use a holoCamera?” Pliny slaps his
leg. “I’d give away one of my Roses just to see—”
      “My goodmen. Enough.” Augustus cuts him off, tapping his finger on
the desk. Pliny and Leto share a grin and turn back to Augustus. “Your
recommendation, Pliny?”
      “Of course.” Pliny clears his throat. “Unlike their propaganda and
cyber attacks, the brutality is quite simple to counter. Ares or not, issue a
simple reply. Our kill teams are prepared for tactical strikes on several
terrorist training grounds beneath Mars’s surface. We should strike now. If
we wait, I fear the Sovereign’s Praetorians will take matters into their own
hands. Luneborn don’t understand Mars. They’ll slag it up.”
      “A fool pulls the leaves. A brute chops the trunk. A sage digs the
roots.” Augustus pauses. “Something Lorn au Arcos once said to my father.
It’s engraved on the Hall of Blades in New Thebes. Striking training
grounds will do nothing except fill the holoNet with pretty explosions. I tire
of political plays. Our strategy must change. With every bombing, the
Sovereign grows wearier of my administration.”
      “You govern Mars,” Leto says. “Not Venus or Earth. Ours is not a
placid planet. What does she expect?”
      “Results.”
      “What do you have in mind, my liege?” Pliny asks.
      “I intend to poison the Sons of Ares’s roots. I want suicide bombers,
not Grays. Find the ugliest, nastiest Reds on Mars, hold their families
hostage, and threaten to kill their sons and daughters if the fathers do not do
as we command. Focus the suicide bombers on surface areas with high
youth density as well as two choice mines. No women bombers. I want
social divide. Women against violence.”
      How little life costs here. Just words in the air.
      “Urban areas too,” he continues. “Not just Browns and Red miners and
agriculturalists. I want dead Blue and Green children in schools or arcades
next to Sons of Ares glyphs. Then we’ll see if other Colors still sing that
girl’s gorydamn song.”
      My heart dips a beat. Eo’s song spread further than she dreamed,
reaching the holoNet and ripping across the Solar System, shared over a
billion times thanks to anarchist hacker groups. Time and again, I fear I’ll
be recognized. Perhaps some Gold will search through the records to find
that Eo’s husband’s name was also Darrow. But even I hardly recognize that
skeletal, pale boy. And as for names? There are no true records for lowRed
names. I had a number designation given to me by some officious Copper
administrator. L17L6363. And L17L6363 was hanged from his neck until
dead, whereupon his body was stolen by an unknown perpetrator and
presumably buried in the deep mines.
     “You plan to alienate Red from the other Colors, then alienate the Sons
from Red.” Pliny smiles. “My liege, sometimes I wonder why you even
need me.”
     “Do not patronize me, Pliny. It’s beneath the both of us.”
     Pliny bows. “Indeed. Apologies, my liege.”
     Augustus looks back to Leto. “You’re squirming like a pup.”
     “I worry this will make matters worse.” Leto frowns to himself. “Right
now the Sons are a nuisance, yes. But hardly our chief plight. If we do this,
we could be pouring fuel on the flames. And worse, we’d be as guilty as the
Sons themselves. Terrorists.”
     “There is no guilt.” Pliny peers idly at a stream of data on his datapad
“Not when you’re the judge.”
     Leto isn’t satisfied. “My liege, our imperative to rule exists because we
are fit to best guide mankind. We are Plato’s philosopher kings. Our cause
is order. We provide stability. The Sons are anarchists. Their cause is chaos.
We should use that as our weapon. Not Grays in the night. Bombers
amongst children.”
     “We should aspire to a higher purpose?” Pliny asks.
     “Yes! Perhaps fashion a media campaign against the Sons. Darrow,
wouldn’t you agree?”
     Again, I do not answer. Not until the ArchGovernor acknowledges my
presence. He does not value impudence or impropriety unless it benefits
him.
     “Idealism,” Pliny sighs. “Admirable in the young, if misguided.”
     “Take care in talking down to me, Politico,” Leto growls, scanning
Pliny’s smirking face for the absent Peerless scar.
     “Your plan should be less brutal, ArchGovernor. That is my point.”
     “Brutality.” Augustus lets the word hang in the air. “It is neither evil
nor good. It is simply an adjective of a thing, an action in this case. What
you must parse is the nature of the action. Is it evil or good to stop terrorists
who bomb innocents?”
     “Good. I suppose.”
     “Then what do our methods matter so long as we harm fewer
innocents than they would harm if we continue to allow them to exist?”
Augustus folds his long-fingered hands. “But at the core, this is no
philosophical issue. It is a political one. The Sons of Ares are not the threat.
Not at all. All they are is a weapon for our political enemies, namely the
Bellona, to use as an excuse to claim I cannot control Mars.
      “The curlyhairs already seek to strip me of the Governorship. As you
know, the Sovereign has sole power to remove me from the position, even
without a vote from the Senate. If she wishes, she can give Mars to another
house—Bellona, our allies the Julii, even a non-Martian house. None of
these entities would run Mars as effectively as I. And when Mars is run
effectively, all benefit—low and high. I am not a despot. But a father must
cuff the ears of his children if they make attempt to set fire to his house; if I
must kill a few thousand for the greater good, for helium-3 to flow, and for
the citizens of this planet to continue to live in a world untorn by war, then I
will.
      “Which brings us to Darrow au Andromedus.” Now his cold eyes turn
on me, fresh from ordering the deaths of a thousand innocents, and I cannot
help but flinch as a dark hate rises inside me. I bow my head in polite
deference.
      “My liege. You summoned me?”
      “I did. And your purpose here shall be brief. You were a gambit when I
took you from the Institute and put you in my employ. You know this?”
      “Yes.”
      “I thought your merit to be sufficient, and I found your rivalry with
Cassius au Bellona amusing in a schoolyard way. But the bloodfeud
declared between you has become,” he spares a glance at Pliny,
“burdensome to my interests, both economically and politically. Substantial
revenues have been lost due to tariff increases to the Core, where Bellona
supporters lie. Houses waver in their commitment to honoring deals made
years ago at the trade table. So, as an act of reconciliation to these
aggrieved parties, I have decided to sell your contract to another house.”
      I shudder inside.
      “My liege …,” I try to interject. This cannot happen. If he strips me of
my place, nearly three years of work will have been for nothing. “If I may
—”
      “You may not.” He opens a drawer and idly tosses a slab of meat to his
lion. The lion waits for Augustus to snap his fingers before eating. “The
decision was made a month ago. There is no use bandying words with me.
I’m not Quicksilver negotiating the price of lithium futures. Pliny …”
      “The particulars are rather simple, Darrow. So they shall be easy to
grasp.” Pliny hasn’t taken his eyes from me. “The ArchGovernor has been
overly kind in giving you the fair warning in case of termination, as
stipulated in your contract.”
      “My contract says I’m to be given six months’ fair warning.”
      “If you’ll recall section eight, subsection C, clause four, you’re to be
given six months’ fair warning unless you fail to act in a manner befitting a
lancer of the esteemed House Augustus.”
      “Is this a joke?” I look to Leto and Augustus.
      “Do you see us laughing?” Pliny asks primly. “No? Not even a scoff or
chortle?”
      “Of all the lancers, I came in second at the Academy! You couldn’t
even make it through the Institute.”
      “Oh, it’s not that! You did well … enough.”
      “Then what?”
      “It is your constant presence on HC talk shows.”
      “I’ve never gone on the HC! I don’t even watch it!”
      “Oh, please. You relish your own celebrity. Even though they mock
you, you bathe in the limelight and cloak this house with shame. We know
your datapad search histories. We see you preening at yourself on the HC as
though it were your personal mirror. The stories run on you and the
ArchGovernor’s daughter—”
      “Mustang is in court on Luna!”
      “Which you likely encouraged. Did you ask her to join the Sovereign’s
court? Is it part of your plan to divide daughter from father?”
      “You’re spinning horseshit, Pliny.”
      “And you create a tawdry name for Augustus. You brawl with Bellona
in baths set aside for refreshment and contemplation. This we cannot
abide.”
      I don’t even know what to say. He’s making it up. There’s enough in
reality to make a case, but he lies just to spit in my eye, just to show that I
am in his power.
      Pliny continues. “The termination of the contract will occur in three
days.”
      “Three days,” I echo.
      “Till then, you will accompany us to the surface of Luna and stay in
the residence provided for the House Augustus for the Summit, though, as
of this moment, you are no longer a lancer of this house. You do not
represent the ArchGovernor and may not use his name to gain access to
facilities nor curry favor with young ladies or young men, neither in boast,
promise, or threat. Your house datapad will be confiscated. Your lancer ID
codes have already been downgraded and you will cease and desist
participation in all projects to which you were previously assigned.”
      “I’ve only been assigned construction projects.”
      Pliny’s lips crawl into a reptilian smile. “Then this shall be an easy
transition.”
      “To whom am I being sold?” I manage. Augustus doesn’t look in my
eyes as he abandons me. He pets his lion. You would guess I’m not even in
the room. Leto stares at the ground. Ashamed. He’s nobler than this
charade, but Augustus wanted him here to watch, to learn how to amputate
a rotten limb.
      “You are not being sold, Darrow. Despite your birth, I would have
expected you to understand your place. We are not Pinks or Obsidians to be
sold as slaves. Your services are being traded at auction,” Pliny says.
      “It’s the same gory thing,” I hiss. “You’re abandoning me. Whoever
buys my services cannot protect me from the Bellona. Those curlyhair
bastards will hunt me down and kill me. The only reason they didn’t two
months ago was because …”
      “Because you were an Augustan representative?” Pliny asks. “But the
ArchGovernor does not owe you anything, Darrow. Is that the
misapprehension you suffer? In fact, you owe him! Protecting you costs us
money. It costs us opportunities, contracts, trade. And that cost has proven
too dear. We must be seen to promote peace with the Bellona. The
Sovereign wants peace. You? You’re a source of friction, a chafing burr in
our proverbial saddle, and an instrument of war. So now we melt our sword
into a plowshare.”
      “But not before you use it to lop off my head.”
      “Darrow, do not beg.” Pliny sighs. “Show some resolve, young man.
Your time here has expired, yes, but you’ve got pluck. You’ve got the vigor
of a young man. Now, straighten that spine of yours and leave with the
dignity of a Gold who knows he tried his best.” His eyes laugh at me. “That
means leave this office. Now, my goodman, before Leto throws you out on
your preposterously toned buttocks.”
      I stare at the ArchGovernor.
      “Is this what you take me for? Some sniveling child to be pushed into
a corner?”
      “Darrow, it’d be best if—” Leto begins.
      “It is you who have pushed us into a corner,” Pliny answers, putting a
hand on my shoulder. “If you’re worried you won’t receive a severance
package, you will. Enough money to—”
      “The last time one of the ArchGovernor’s lackeys touched me, I buried
a knife in his cerebellum. Six times.” I look at his hand as he quickly
withdraws it. I square my shoulders. “I do not answer to a scarless Pixie
whelp. I am a Peerless Scarred. ArchPrimus of the 542nd class of the
Institute of Mars. I answer to the ArchGovernor alone.”
      I take a step toward Augustus, causing Leto to take a protective angle.
The length of my temper is well remembered. “You put Julian au Bellona in
the Passage with me, my liege.” My eyes burn down at him. “I killed him
there for you. I warred against Karnus for you. I kept my mouth, the mouths
of my men, sealed after you tried to buy your son victory at the Institute.”
Leto flinches at that. “I altered the recordings. I proved myself better than
your blood heirs. Now, my liege, you say I’m a liability.”
      “You are a Peerless Scarred,” the ArchGovernor agrees, examining
data on his desk. “But you are of little substance. Your family is dead. They
left you with no lands, no holdings of resources or industry, no position in
government. All was seized as their debts came due, including their honor.
What scraps you have been given by your betters, cherish. What favor you
curried, remember.”
      “I thought you favored deeds, not titles. My liege, Mustang has left
you. Do not make the mistake of severing me from you as well.”
      Finally he raises his head to look at me. Eyes inhuman, belonging to
something else—a distant, callous calculation fueled by monstrous,
inhuman pride. A pride that goes beyond him and stretches back to man’s
first feeble steps into black space. It is the pride of a dozen generations of
fathers and grandfathers and sisters and brothers, all distilled now into a
single brilliant, perfect vessel that bears no failure, abides no flaws.
      “My enemies embarrassed you. So they embarrassed me, Darrow. You
told me you would win. But then you lost. And that changes everything.”
5
Supper

       I will soon die.
       That is the thought I carry with me as our shuttle coasts away from
Augustus’s flagship and flits through the Scepter Armada. I sit amongst the
lancers, but I am not one of them. They know. Appropriately, they do not
speak to me. Whatever bond they could make does not matter. I have no
political capital. I overhear Tactus being offered a wager to see how long
I’ll last outside of Augustus’s protection. One lancer says three days. Tactus
argues ferociously against the number, showing the true extent of the
loyalty I earned from him at the Institute.
       “Ten days,” he declares. “At least ten days.”
       It was he who launched the escape pod without me. I always knew his
friendship was conditional. Yet still the wound gnaws deep, carving in me a
loneliness I can’t express. A loneliness that I’ve always felt amongst these
Golds, but tricked myself into forgetting. I am not one of them. So I sit
there in silence, staring out the window as we pass the gathered fleet and
wait for Luna to appear.
       My contract ends on the final evening of the Summit, where all ruling
families gather on Luna to deal with matters pressing and frivolous. That is
the three-day window I have to improve my stock, to make others think that
I am undervalued by the ArchGovernor and ripe for recruitment. But no
matter my value, I am marred. Someone had me, then threw me away. Who
would want such a used thing?
       This is my fate. Despite my Golden face and talents, I am a
commodity. It makes me want to tear my bloodydamn Sigils out. If I’m to
be a slave, I should at least look a slave.
       To make matters worse, there’s the price on my head. Not officially, of
course. That is illegal, because I am not an enemy of the state. Yet my
enemy is far worse. Far crueler than any government. She is the woman
who sent Karnus and Cagney to the Academy.
       They say every night since I stole Julian’s life in the Passage, his
mother, Julia au Bellona, has sat at the long table of her family’s high-hall
upon the slopes of Olympus Mons and lifted the semicircular lid of the
silver tray brought to her by the Pink manservants. Every night, the tray
remains empty. And every night she sighs in sadness, peering down the
table at her large family only to repeat the same vindictive words: “It is
clear I am unloved. If I were loved, there would be a heart here to sate my
hunger for vengeance. If I were loved, my boy’s murderer would no longer
draw breath. If I were loved, my family would honor their brother. But I am
not. He is not. They do not. What have I done to deserve such a hateful
family?” Then the grand Bellona family will watch their matriarch uncoil
from her chair, her body withering from hunger, nursing instead on hate and
vengeance, and they will remain silent as she leaves the room, more wraith
than woman.
     What has kept my heart from her plate is the ArchGovernor’s arms,
money, and name. Politics, the very thing I hate, has kept the breath in me.
But in three days, that aegis will be a shadow of memory, and all that will
protect me are the lessons my teachers have given me.
     “It’ll be a duel,” one of the lancers says. Then louder. “Can’t turn that
down and keep his honor for long. Not if Cassius himself offers it.”
     “Old Reaper has a few tricks up his sleeve,” Tactus says. “You might
not have been there, but he didn’t kill Apollo with his smile.”
     “Used a razor, didn’t you, Darrow?” another lancer asks, tone
mocking. “Haven’t seen you on the fencing grounds of late.”
     “You’ve never seen him there,” says another. “The Pixie avoids what
he’s not good at, eh?”
     Roque stirs angrily beside me. I put a hand on his forearm and turn
slowly to regard the offending lancer. Victra sits behind him, idly watching
the scene.
     “I don’t fence,” I say.
     “Don’t? Or can’t?” someone asks with a laugh.
     “Leave him be. Razormasters are expensive,” Tactus notes.
     “Is that how it is, Tactus?” I ask.
     He makes a face. “Oh, come now. Just having a go at you. So
gorydamn serious. You used to be more playful.”
     Roque says something to make Tactus scowl and turn away, but I don’t
hear. I’ve sunken into memory, where this Golden game seemed so easy.
What has changed? Mustang.
      “You’re more than this,” she whispered as I left her for the Academy.
Tears swelled in her eyes, though her voice did not waver. “You don’t have
to be a killer. You don’t have to court war.”
      “What other choice do I have?” I asked.
      “Me. I’m the other choice. Stay for me. Stay for what might be. At the
Institute, you made followers of boys and girls who have never known
loyalty. If you go to the Academy, you abandon that to be my father’s
warlord. That’s not what you are. That is not the man I …” She did not turn,
but her face changed as her sentence trailed away, lips drawing a hard line.
      Love? Was that what we built in the year after the Institute?
      If so, the word stuck in her throat, because she knew, as I knew, that I
had not given her all of me. I had not shared all that I am. Greedily, I kept
secrets. And how could someone like her, someone with so much self-
worth, bare herself and throw her heart at a man who gave so little in
return? So she closed her golden eyes, shoved the razor into my hands, and
told me to go.
      I don’t fault her. She chose politics, governance—peace, which is what
she thinks her people need. I chose the blade, because it is what my people
need. It fills me with a strange emptiness knowing that I was enough for her
when I was never enough for Eo. Roque was right. I pushed her away.
      I didn’t push Sevro away. I asked him to be stationed with me, then
suddenly he was reassigned to Pluto like many of the Howlers, relegated to
protecting far construction operations from petty pirate raids. I now suspect
Pliny’s hand in that.
      My path has never felt lonelier.
      “You’ll not be abandoned,” Roque says, leaning in close. “Other
families will want you for themselves. Don’t let Tactus in your head. The
Bellona won’t make a move against you.”
      “Of course they won’t,” I lie. He can still sense my fear.
      “Violence isn’t allowed in the Citadel, Darrow. Especially bloodfeuds.
Even duels are outlawed unless consent is given by the Sovereign herself.
Simply stay on Citadel grounds till you’ve a new house, and all will be
well. Bide your time, do what you must, and in a year, the ArchGovernor
will feel like a fool when you’ve risen under the tutelage of another. There
is more than one path to the top. Always remember that, brother.”
      He grips my shoulder.
     “You know I would ask my mother and father to bid for you … but
they won’t go against Augustus.”
     “I know.” They could spend the millions on the contract and not even
notice the loss, but Roque’s mother has not sat a Senator for twenty years
because of her charity. Her lot is thrown in with Augustus’s contingent in
the Senate. What he wills, she supports.
     “I’ll be fine. You’re right,” I say as Luna appears in the window,
hushing the aides, and filling me with dread. The city moon of Earth.
Orbiting satellites and installations encircle it like a steel angel’s halo
wrapped around a ball of amber held to the sun. “I’ll be fine.”
6
Icarus

     We land near the Citadel. Sticky, polluted wind bends the towering
trees near our landing pad. Perspiration quickly beads along the top of my
high collar. Already I do not like this ugly place. Despite the fact that we
land here on Citadel grounds, which are far from the nearest cities and
surrounded by forests and lakes, the air here cloys and sticks to the lungs.
     On the horizon, just past the spiked spires of the Citadel’s western
campus, Earth hovers, swollen and blue, reminding me that I am so far from
home. The gravity here is less than Mars’s, only one-sixth Earth’s, and
makes me feel unsettled and clumsy. I seem to float when I walk. And even
though coordination quickly returns, my body suffers its own lightness with
strange feelings of claustrophobia.
     Another vessel lands to the north.
     “Looks like Bellona silver,” Roque says quietly, squinting against the
sunset.
     I chuckle.
     He glances back at me. “What?”
     “Just imagining having a pulseRocket right about now.”
     “Well, that’s just … lovely of you.” He walks along. I follow, eyes
lingering on the vessel. “I do love the sunsets of Luna. Like we’re in
Homer’s world. Sky a hot shade of fresh-forged bronze.”
     Above, the alien sky melts into night with the long setting of the sun.
For two weeks, the daylight will disappear from this part of the moon. Two
weeks of night. Luxury yachts cruise through this strange day’s end, while
nimble Blue-piloted ripWings soar past on patrol like bats glued together
from shattered ebony.
     The one-sixth gravity lets these Luneborn build to their heart’s desire.
And build they do. Beyond the Citadel grounds, the horizon is fenced with
towers and cityscape. RungPaths wind everywhere so that citizens can pull
themselves through the air with ease. The network of rungs stretch between
high towers as would ivy, linking the heavens with the hells of the
lowDistricts. Along them, thousands of men and women crawl like ants on
vines, while Gray patrol skiffs buzz around the thoroughfares.
       The household of Augustus is assigned a villa nestled between thirty
acres of pines on Citadel grounds. It’s a pretty thing amongst other pretty
things in this stately place. There are gardens, paths, fountains carved with
little winged boys of stone. All that sort of frivolity.
       “Fancy a session of kravat?” I ask Roque, nodding to the training
facility beside the villa. “My mind’s running away with itself.”
       “I can’t.” Roque winces, stepping out of the way of our fellow lancers
and their attendants who file into the villa. “I have to attend the conference
on Capitalism in the Governed Age.”
       “If you wanted a nap, I’m sure they have beds in the villa.”
       “You joking? Regulus ag Sun is giving the keynote.”
       I whistle. “Quicksilver himself. So you’re going to learn how to make
diamonds out of gravel? You hear the rumor about him owning the
contracts of two Olympic Knights?”
       “It’s not rumor. Least according to Mother. Reminds me of what
Augustus said to the Sovereign at her coronation. ‘A man is never too
young to kill, never too wise, never too strong, but he can damn well be too
rich.’”
       “Arcos said that.”
       “No, I’m sure it was Augustus.”
       I shake my head. “Check your facts, brother. Lorn au Arcos said it, and
the Sovereign turned to reply, ‘You forget, Rage Knight, I am a woman.’”
       Arcos is as much myth as man, at least to my generation. Reclusive
now, he was the Sword of Mars and the Rage Knight for over sixty years.
Peerless Knights across the Society have offered him the deeds to moons if
he would but tutor them for a week in his form of kravat, the Willow Way.
It was he who sent me the knifeRing that killed Apollo and then offered me
a place in his house. I rejected it then, choosing Augustus over the old man.
       “‘You forget, I am a woman,’” Roque repeats. He cherishes these
stories of their empire the way I cherished stories of the reaper and the Vale.
“When I get back, let’s talk. Not the usual banter.”
       “You mean you won’t yammer on about a childhood crush, drink too
much wine, wax poetical about the shape of Quinn’s smile and the beauty
of Etruscan grave sites before falling asleep?” I ask.
       His cheeks flush, but he puts a hand over his heart. “On my honor.”
     “Then bring a bottle of foolishly expensive wine, and we can talk.”
     “I’ll bring three.”
     I watch him leave, eyes colder than my smile.
     Several of the other lancers attend the conference with Roque. The rest
make themselves comfortable as Augustus’s Gray security teams comb the
grounds. Obsidian bodyguards trail Golds like shadows. Pinks sway
gracefully into the villa in a constant stream, ordered from the Citadel’s
Garden by members of the ArchGovernor’s household staff who find
themselves bored from travel and seek a little merriment.
     A Pink Citadel steward guides me to my room. I laugh when I arrive.
“Perhaps there has been a mistake,” I say, looking around the small room
with its adjoining washroom and closet. “I’m not a broom.”
     “I don’t under—”
     “He’s not a broom, so he won’t fit in this closet,” Theodora says,
standing in the doorway behind us. “It is beneath his station.” She looks
around, pert nose sniffing disdainfully. “These would not even suit as closet
to my clothes on Mars.”
     “This is the Citadel. Not Mars.” The steward’s pink eyes survey the
lines on Theodora’s aged face. “There is less room for useless things.”
     Theodora smiles sweetly and gestures to the rose-quartz tree pinned to
the man’s breast. “I say! Is that the black poplar of Garden Dryope?”
     “Your first time seeing it, I would guess,” he says haughtily before
turning to me. “I don’t know how they raised your Pinks in Mars’s Gardens,
dominus, but on Luna your slave should do her best to look less affected.”
     “Of course. How rude of me,” Theodora apologizes. “I merely thought
you would know Matron Carena.”
     The steward pauses. “Matron Carena …”
     “We were girls together in the Gardens. Tell her Theodora says hello
and would call on her if time is found.”
     “You’re a Rose.” His face goes sheet white.
     “Was. All petals wilt. Oh, but do tell me your name. I would so like to
commend you to her for your hospitality.”
     He mumbles something quite inaudible and departs, bowing lower to
Theodora than to me.
     “Was that fun?” I ask.
     “Always nice to flex a little muscle. Even if everything else is starting
to droop.”
      “Seems my career ends where yours began.” I chuckle morbidly and
walk over to the holoDisplay sitting near the bed.
      “I wouldn’t,” she says.
      I bite my bottom lip, our signal for spying devices.
      “Well, of course, that. But the holoNet is … not where you want to be
right now.”
      “What are they saying about me?”
      “They’re wondering where you’ll be buried.”
      I haven’t time to reply before knuckles rap against the frame of my
room’s doorway.
      I follow Victra’s Pink to her room’s private terrace. Seems her bath
alone is larger than my bed.
      “It’s not fair,” a voice says from behind the ivory-white trunk of a
lavender tree. I turn to see Victra playing with the thorns of a shrub “You
being cut loose like a Gray mercenary.”
      “Since when have you been concerned with what’s fair, Victra?”
      “Must you always fence with me?” she asks. “Come sit.” Even with
the scars that distinguish her from her sister, her long form and luminous
face is without true fault. She sits smoking some designer burner that smells
like a sunset over a logged forest. She’s heavier of bone than Antonia, taller,
and seems to have been melted into being, like a spearhead cooling into
angular shape. Her eyes flash with annoyance. “I’m as far from an enemy as
you have, Darrow.”
      “So what are you? A friend?”
      “A man in your position could use friends, no?”
      “I’d rather have a dozen Stained bodyguards.”
      “Who has the money for that?” she laughs.
      “You do.”
      “Well, they couldn’t protect you from yourself.”
      “I’m a bit more worried about Bellona razors.”
      “Worry? Is that what I saw on your face as we descended?” She lets a
merry sigh escape her lips. “Curious. See, I thought it was dread. Terror. All
the truly unsettling things. Because you know this moon will be your
grave.”
      “You too? I thought we weren’t fencing anymore,” I say.
      “You’re right. It’s just I find you very odd. Or, at least I find your
choice in friends to be odd.” She comes to sit in front of me on the lip of the
fountain. Her heels scrape along the aged stone. “You’ve always kept me at
arm’s length while bringing Tactus and Roque close. I understand Roque,
even if he is as soft as butter. But Tactus? It’s like flossing with a viper and
expecting not to get bitten. Is it because he was your man at the Institute
that you think he’s your friend?”
      “Friend?” I laugh at the idea. “After Tactus told me how his brothers
broke his favorite violin when he was a boy, I had Theodora spend half my
bank account on a Stratovarian violin from Quicksilver’s auction house.
Tactus didn’t thank me. It was as if I’d handed him a stone. He asked what
it was for. I said, ‘For you to play.’ He asked why. ‘Because we’re friends.’
He looked back down at it and walked away. Two weeks later, I discovered
he took it and sold it and used the money for Pinks and drugs. He is not my
friend.”
      “He’s what his brothers made him to be,” she notes, hesitating as if
reluctant to share her information with me. “When do you think he’s ever
received something without someone wanting something in return? You
made him uncomfortable.”
      “Why do you think I’m wary with you?” I lean closer. “It’s because
you always want something, Victra. Just like your sister.”
      “Ah. I thought it might be Antonia. She’s always ruining things. Ever
since the shewolf gnawed her way out of mother’s womb and stole human
clothes. Good that I was born first, else she might have strangled me in my
crib. And she’s only my half sister anyway. Different fathers. Mother never
saw much point in monogamy. You know Antonia even goes by Severus
instead of Julii just to take a piss on Mother. Cantankerous brat. And I get
saddled with her moral baggage. Ridiculous.”
      Victra plays with the many jade rings on her fingers. I find them odd,
contrasting with the Spartan severity of her scarred face.
      “Why are you talking with me, Victra? I can’t do anything for you. I
have no station. I have no command. I have no money. And I have no
reputation. All the things you value.”
      “Oh … I value other things too, darling. But you do have a reputation,
all right. Pliny’s made sure of that.”
      “So he did play a part in the gossip. Thought Tactus was just running
his mouth.”
      “A part? Darrow, he’s been at war with you since the moment you
kneeled to Augustus.” She laughs. “Before then, even. He counseled
Augustus to kill you then and there, or at least try you for the murder of
Apollo. Didn’t you know?” She shakes her head at my blank stare. “The
fact that you’re just now realizing this shows just how unequipped you are
to play his game. And because of that, you’re going to be killed. That’s why
I’m speaking with you. I’d rather you found an alternative instead of
sulking in your beastly quarters. Otherwise, Cassius au Bellona is going to
come and he’s going to take a knife and dig right here …” She caresses my
chest with a long-nailed finger, etching the outline of my heart. “… and
give his mother her first real meal in years.”
      “Then what is your suggestion?”
      “You stop being a little bitch.” She smiles and holds out a dataSlip.
Grudgingly, I take the edge of the thin metal slip, but she holds on, pulling
me toward the edge of the fountain, between her legs. Her lips part, her
tongue playing along the top as her eyes trace my face, up and up to my
eyes, where they try to spark a fire. But there’s none there for her. I try to
pull back. “Stop hesitating.” With a feline sigh, she lets the dataSlip go. I
run it over my personal datapad and an advertisement for a tavern appears
on my display.
      “This isn’t on Citadel grounds,” I say.
      “So?”
      “So, if I leave, it’s open season on my head.”
      “Then don’t advertise your leaving.”
      I take a step back. “How much are they paying you?”
      “You think this is a setup!”
      “Is it?”
      “No.”
      “How do I know you’re telling the truth?”
      “Most people can’t afford the truth. I can.”
      “Oh, that’s right. I forgot. You never lie.”
      “I am of the gens Julii.” She stands slowly, anger uncoiling like a
razor. “My family trades in commerce enough to buy continents. Who could
afford to purchase my honor? If … one day I become your enemy, I will tell
you. And I will tell you why.”
      “Everyone’s honest till they’re caught in a lie.”
      Her laugh is husky and makes me feel small and boyish, reminding me
she’s seven years older than I. “Then stay, Reaper. Trust in chance. Trust in
friends. Hide here till someone buys your contract, and pray they didn’t do
it just to serve you up to the Bellona like a suckling pig.”
      I weigh the odds. “Well, when you put it that way.”
      “Colonel Valentin?” Victra asks the shorter of the two Grays who wait
for us on the ramp of the shuttle. It’s a shit can. One of the ugliest fliers I’ve
ever seen. Like the front half of a hammerhead shark. I eye the taller of the
Grays warily.
      “Yes, domina,” Valentin says, nodding his cinderblock head with the
rigid precision of a man risen through the ranks. “You are sure you were not
followed?”
      “Certain as death,” Victra says.
      “We should depart fastlike, then.”
      I follow Victra into the shuttle, scanning the grounds behind us. We
wore ghostCloaks as soon as we departed Augustus’s villa. A dozen hidden
hallways and six old gravLifts later, we arrived in a dusty, seldom-used
section of the Citadel’s launch pads. Theodora left us there. She wanted to
come, but I won’t take her where we’re going.
      A Gray scans Victra and me for bugs as we board the ship.
      The ship’s ramp slides closed behind us. Twelve craggy Grays fill the
small passenger hold of the shuttle. They’re not the dashing sort. Just
craftsmen of a dark trade.
      Though there are averages, Colors are diverse in composition due to
human genetics and the differing ecosystems throughout the Society. The
Grays of Venus are often darker and more compact than those of Mars, but
families move. The talent levels in each Color are even more variable than
appearance. Most Grays aren’t destined for anything more than patrolling
shopping centers and city streets. Some go to the armies. Some to the
mines. But then there are the Grays who were born a special breed of
wicked and clever and have been trained all their lives to hunt the Gold
enemies of their Gold masters. Like these in the shuttle with us. They call
them lurchers—after the mutt dogs of Earth crossbred for uncommon
stealth, cunning, and speed, all for one purpose: killing things bigger than
they are.
      “We’re bound for Lost City and it’s just the twelve of you?” I ask.
      I know they’re enough. I just don’t like Grays. So I push their buttons.
      They eye me with the quiet reserve of a family meeting a stranger on
the road. Valentin’s the father. He’s built like a squat block of dirty ice
carved by a rusted blade, and his sun-blasted face is dark and set with quick
eyes. His lieutenant, Sun-hwa, leans toward us, tough and gnarled as an
olive tree.
      Both are Earthborn by the looks of their continentally ethnic features.
These Grays wear no triangular badge of the Society’s Legion on their
civilian street clothes.
      “We’re tasked with your protection, dominus,” says Valentin as Sun-
hwa loads an exotic circular weapon on the inside of her left wrist. Looks
plasma based. “My team has prepared a secure route. Estimated traveling
time: twenty-four minutes.”
      “If Pliny finds out where I am going, or if the Bellona know I’m out of
the Citadel …”
      “The lurchers know the situation,” Victra says.
      “I don’t see a Gold badge. Mercenaries?”
      “Means we are good enough to live this long, dominus,” Valentin says
flatly. “We’ve prepared for all eventualities. Contingency plans and support
have been organized.”
      “How much support?”
      “Enough. We’re just the transporters, dominus.” His mouth twitches
into a smile and I take his word for it. “Bigger problem than the Bellona is
third parties thinking an opportunity’s just stumbled their way. Where we’re
going, there will be a hell of a lot of third parties, dominus. Shit complicates
our ROI. Sun-hwa?”
      “Wear this.” Sun-hwa tosses me a bag of plain clothing. Her voice
drones on in a monotone drawl. “You’re tall can’t do shitall about that but
we’ll do a quick dye job with this this and this.” She tosses Victra another
bag. “For you boss thought you’d dress too fancy.”
      Victra laughs at that.
      “Muzzles off, boys,” Valentin barks as the ship trembles and rises in
the air. “We’re live.” Thumpers and burners prime in practiced hands.
Staccato sound of steel on steel. Like metal knuckles cracking as magnetic
rounds go into chambers. The lurchers conceal weapons in hidden holsters
overtop tight scarabSkin armor. Three wear illegal wrist weapons. I eye the
contraband as I slip into my scarabSkin. It drinks in the light, a strange
pupil-like black. More the absence of color than anything else. Better than
the duroArmor we had at the Institute, it’ll stop some blades and the
occasional projectile weapon like the common scorcher.
     The ship shudders as its main engines overtake the vertical thrusters.
     “Talon and Minotaur, be advised. Icarus is on the move,” Valentin
rasps into his com. “Repeat. Icarus is on the move.”
7
The Afterbirth

      On Luna, there is no dark. No true dark, at least. Lights of a million
shades swim together, glossing over the moon’s jagged, cracking steel skin
of cityscape. Snaking public trams and air thoroughfares, flashing
communication centers, bustling restaurants, and austere police stations
weave into the metal dermis of the city like blood capillaries, nerve
endings, sweat glands, and hair follicles.
      We fall away from Gold districts, forsaking the high reaches of the city
where stately shuttles and gravBoots ferry Golds to opera houses atop
kilometers-high towers. We dive down past the wealthy Silver and Copper
districts, wending our way through rungPaths and aerial trains, through the
midDistricts where the Yellows, Greens, Blues, Violets reside, past the
lowDistrict where Grays and Oranges make their homes.
      Down and down we go to the gutters of the city where the roots of this
colossal steel jungle burrow into the ground. Myriad lowColors ride public
transportation from factories to their windowless apartments, some no
larger than one meter by three. Only room enough for a bed. Cars rattle out
exhaust in clogged beacon-lit boulevards. The deeper we go, the fewer the
lights, the dirtier the buildings, the stranger the animals, but the more
brilliant the graffiti. I glimpse Gray police standing over arrested Brown
vandals who covered an apartment complex with the image of a hanging
girl. My wife. Ten stories tall, hair burning, rendered in digital paint. My
chest constricts as we pass, cracking the walls I’ve built around her
memory. I’ve seen her hanged a thousand times now as her martyrdom
spreads across the worlds, city by city. Yet each time, it strikes me like a
physical blow, nerve endings shivering in my chest, heart beating fast, neck
tight just under the jaw. How cruel a life, that the sight of my dead wife
means hope.
      No matter our reputations, no enemy would seek us here. No ears to
listen. No eyes to see. This is a place of gang killings, robberies, turf battles,
drug trade. That my new friend wants such human privacy, privacy not even
a jamField can really offer in the Citadel and the High City, means much. It
worries me. Means the rules are void. But Victra was right and Roque was
not. Patience will do me nothing. I must take a risk.
      The team of lurchers has secured an abandoned garage. They provide
security for the shuttle while Valentin’s team escorts me from the garage
into the bustle of the dirty street outside. Refuse and water make bogs out of
alleys. Humid air is thick with the sweet musk of rot and the charred soot of
burning garbage. Hawkers cry out wares from cracked sidewalks, clogged
with Reds, Browns, Grays, Oranges of all species—urchin, invalid, working
class, gangers, tweakers, mothers, fathers, beggars, cripples, children. The
lost.
      Eo would say this is the hell they’ve built their heaven upon. And
she’d be right. Gazing up, I see more than half a kilometer of tenement
buildings before the polluted haze makes a ceiling for the human jungle.
Clotheslines and electrical lines crisscross overhead like vines. This sight is
hopeless. What is there to change here but everything?
      We’re to meet at the Lost Wee Den. It is a large, tall tavern with a
flickering red sign covered in pithy graffiti. Fifteen levels, all open and
looking down on a central drinking hall of tables and booths filled with
some two hundred customers. I can smell the piss in the metal booths,
which sag from use. Bottles rattle and glasses clink as swill is slammed
back. Indigo and pink lights flicker on the fifteenth floor, where they’ve
dancers and private rooms for customers. I pass with Valentin through two
bouncers with biomod hands—one Obsidian with skin pale as bleached
marble and arms thicker than mine, the other a dark-skinned Gray with a
scorcher muzzle built into his arm.
      The rest of my Grays filter in behind me in staggered intervals. Some
wearing contacts, pretending to be other Colors. One even wearing a
fleshMask to look pretty as a Pink. Can’t even tell it’s digital till you put a
magnet near it. They look like they belong here. I doubt I do, despite the
Obsidian dye job they’ve done to me.
      The Sigils on my hands are covered with Obsidian prosthetics. My hair
is white, eyes black. Skin made paler with cosmetics. Victra and I are too
large to pass for any other Color. Fortunately, Obsidians, though rarer than
the other lowColors, are not out of place down here. I follow Valentin to a
table in an alcove near the back of the hall where a young man lounges
behind a pack of mercenaries and a single Obsidian. A deep silence fills me
as I watch the Obsidian stand and leave the table to sit at an adjacent one.
Others eye him too before remembering themselves and looking down at
their drinks—like water birds as a crocodile glides past. The Obsidian is a
foot taller than I. And the whole of his face is tattooed with a skull. Stained.
      So much for a low profile.
      “Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven?” I ask the reclining man.
      “Reaper! Even Milton knew Lucifer was a petty son of a bitch.” He
smiles enigmatically and waves to the chair across from him. “Do stop
towering over me.”
      He’s not even wearing a disguise. I look over at Victra. “Thought it
was going to be a new friend.”
      “Well, you two have never been friends before. That’d be the new part.
You boys have fun now.”
      “You’re not staying?” I ask.
      “I showed you the door. You have to walk through it.” She squeezes
my butt playfully and sways out. The Jackal watches her leave, leaning
slightly to get a better view.
      “Didn’t think you cared about women.”
      “I could be dead and I’d still appreciate her. But I don’t have to tell
you that. Alone in space for months on end. Ship all to yourself. Whatever
was there to do?”
      I sit across from him. He offers me a bottle of greenish liquor.
      I shake my head. “I drink to forget about men like you.”
      “Ha! An Arcosian insult, if I’m not mistaken. One of Lorn’s best.
Though there’s enough to choose from.” He leans back. Enigmatic in his
dullness. Face plain. Eyes like smooth, worn coins. Hair the color of desert
sand. Lone hand twirling a gold stylus with the quickness of an insect
skittering over blasted ground, crack to crack. “The Jackal of Augustus and
the Reaper of Mars, together again, at long last. How we have fallen.”
      “You chose the venue,” I say as he sets his stylus behind his ear and
takes a chicken leg from a platter on the table. He strips the skin with his
teeth.
      “Does it unnerve you?”
      “Why would it? We both know how fond you are of the dark.”
      He suddenly laughs, a whining high-pitched bark, like a dog being
stabbed. “So much pride to you, Darrow au Andromedus. Family all dead.
Disgraced, penniless things. So average that your parents didn’t even try to
introduce you to society. No friends remaining. No one who knew you
before you slipped into the Institute, so unassuming-like. But how you rose
when given a chance.”
      “Well, at least you still like to talk,” I mutter.
      “And you still like to make enemies.”
      “Everyone has a hobby.” I examine the stump where his right hand
should be. “Desperate for attention? You’re the only Gold alive that
wouldn’t bother getting a new hand.”
      “I wonder why you provoke me still when your reputation is shattered.
Your bank accounts emptied.” I shift in my seat. “Oh, yes. You didn’t
know? Pliny is thorough when he cuts a man’s hamstrings. He emptied all
your funds. So really there’s very little to you. But here you sit, at the
bottom of a moon. Alone. With me, with mine. Throwing insults.”
      “These are yours?” I ask, glancing at the lowColors around us. “I
would have thought they’d disgust you.”
      “Who said you have to like your children?” the Jackal asks pleasantly.
“They are a product of our Golden loins.” He gnaws on the chicken leg,
cracking the bone with his teeth before discarding it. “Do you know what I
have been doing with my time?”
      “Wanking off in the bushes?”
      “Alas, no. My defeat at your hands set me back. I’m not afraid to say
it. You hurt me and my plans. My sister also wounded me. Gagging me?
Binding me naked and throwing me at your feet? That stung, especially
when all the grand lords and ladies of our fine Peerless caste got a chuckle
at my expense.”
      “We both know you don’t feel pain, Adrius.”
      “Oh, call me the Jackal. Hearing ‘Adrius’ from your lips is like
hearing a cat bark.” He shivers, but leans delightedly forward in his seat
when a Brown woman with thick arms and tattoos webbing her pale,
pockmarked skin slips from the kitchens carrying three steaming bowls. She
sets them before us. “Thank you!” he says, taking two for himself.
      I eye the bowl suspiciously.
      “I’m not a poisoner,” he says. “I could poison my father any time I
want, but I don’t. Do you know why?”
      “Because you’ve not gotten what you need out of him.”
      “And that is?”
      “His approval.”
      The Jackal watches me through the steam of his bowl. “Quite. I have
been offered a great deal of apprenticeships. They offer it to my father’s
name, not me. They despise me because I ate students. But it’s such
hypocrisy. What else was I to do? We’re told to win, and I did my best. And
then they criticize. Act noble, as though they didn’t commit murder
themselves. Madness.”
      He shakes his head with a little sigh. “Yes, I could have gone to study
war at the Academy like you. I could have studied politics at the Politico
School on Luna. I might have been a decent Judiciar if I could stomach
Venus. But I will rise without their hypocrisy. Without their schools.”
      “I’ve heard the rumors. Any true?”
      “Most.” He pulls more noodles out of the bowl, spreading red pepper
sauce over them. “I am a businessman now, Darrow. I buy things. I own
things. I create. Of course I’m seen as a money-grubbing Silver by those
pretentious Peerless jackasses. But I am not one of the fading lords of
twentieth-century Europe. I understand there is power in being practical, in
owning things. People. Ideas. Infrastructure. So much more important than
money. So much more insidious than”—he makes a funny motion with his
hand—“spaceships and razors. Tell me, does a ship matter if you can’t
supply and transport the food to feed its crew?”
      “You own this place, don’t you?” I ask.
      “In a manner.” He smiles with too much teeth. “I feel I must be blunt
with you. We were nearly eighteen when we left the Institute. We are now
twenty. I have been two years in exile, and now I wish to return home.”
      “To socialize with Peerless jackasses?” I laugh. “If you have been
paying attention at all, you’ll know I don’t have your father’s ear.”
      “Paying attention …” He shares a glance with Victra and leans
forward. “Reaper. I am the attention. Do you know how much of the
communications industry I have acquired?”
      “No.”
      “Good. That means I’m doing it properly. I’ve acquired more than
twenty percent. With my silent partner, I own nearly thirty. You’re
wondering why? Certainly families like Victra’s do not consider themselves
dirtied by business. After all, the Julii have partaken in trade for centuries.
But media is different for us. Slimy. Leave that to Quicksilver and his ilk.
So why would someone with my lineage dirty his hands with it? Well, I
want you to imagine media as a pipeline to a city in the desert.” He waves
around. “Our metaphorical desert. I can only provide thirty percent of the
content of what comes through that pipeline, but I can affect one hundred
percent of it. My water contaminates the rest. That is the nature of media.
Do I want this city in the desert to hallucinate? Do I want its inhabitants to
writhe in pain? Do I want them to rise up?” He sets his chopsticks down. “It
all starts with what I want.”
      “And what do you want?” I ask.
      “Your head,” he says.
      Our eyes meet like two iron rods colliding, sending stinging
reverberations through the body. A palpable discomfort even being near
him, much less meeting those dead gold orbs. He’s so young. My age, but
there’s a childishness to him, a curiosity despite the ancient cast of his eyes,
that makes him feel like a perversity. It’s not that I feel cruelty and evil
radiating from his eyes. It’s the feeling that crept over me when Mustang
told me how, as a boy, he killed a baby lion because he wanted to see its
insides to understand how it worked.
      “You have a weird sense of humor.”
      “I know. But I’m so glad you get my jokes. So many prickly Peerless
these days. Duels! Honor! Blood! All because they’re bored. There’s no one
left to fight. So gorydamn tedious.”
      “I believe you were making a point.”
      “Ah, yes.” The Jackal runs his hand through his slicked-back hair, like
I’ve seen his father do. “I brought you here because Pliny is an enemy of
mine. He’s made my life very difficult. Even penetrated my harem. Do you
know how many spies of his I’ve had to kill? I went through so many
servants. I’m not trying to make you feel sorry for me,” he says quickly.
      “I was on the verge of it.”
      “Understanding my plight, however, is how you will help me best. As
of now, Pliny controls my father’s favor. Like a snake hissing in his ear.
Leto is his design, did you know that?” I didn’t. “He found the darling boy,
knew he would win my father’s cold heart because he would remind Father
of my dead brother, Claudius. So Pliny cultivated him, trained him, and
convinced my father to adopt him as a ward with aims of making him the
heir. Then you come waltzing into our lives and disrupt Pliny’s plan. It took
two years to dispatch you, but patiently, he did. Just as he did me. Now Leto
will be my father’s heir, and Pliny will be Leto’s master.”
      That hits me hard. I knew Pliny was dangerous. Perhaps I never really
knew just how dangerous.
      “So what’s your plan?” I glance around the room. “Going to take back
your father’s favor with plebeians and pitchforks?”
      “As any Gold with a decent education would know, there’s a certain
crime syndicate that runs things in Lost City. A vast criminal enterprise
that, if you trace it all the to the tip-top, is under the influence of the office
of the Sovereign of our little Society. Octavia au Lune may seem the
paragon of Gold virtue. But she’s got a fetish for the dirty stuff—
assassinations, organizing workers’ strikes in her own ArchGovernors’
domains, rigging appointments. Her handling of Lost City is no different.
      “She and her Furies handpicked the crime family leadership; these
three individuals are her creatures. But here’s the juicy kink. I’ve found
certain members of that same organization who are … restless.”
      I frown. “They don’t like Lune?”
      “She’s an onerous bitch. One who has spat in my father’s eye and
cozied up to the Bellona. But no. My champions don’t think on that plane.
They are lowColors, Darrow. They’re restless to be atop the shitpile.”
      “Why Lost City?” I ask. “What does it matter?”
      “It is merely a piece of the puzzle. I’m going to help these ambitious
lowColors move up, for a price. When they are in power, they are going to
kill off a menace that plagues the Society: Ares and his Sons.”
8
Alliance

      I go cold inside. “The Sons of Ares? I wasn’t aware they were so dire a
threat.”
      “They’re not yet, but they will be,” he says. “The Sovereign knows it.
So does my father, even if it is not in vogue to say it aloud. The Society has
faced terrorist cells before. Throw enough lurcher teams at them and they
are dispatched easily enough. But the Sons are different.
      “They are not a rat biting our heels, but a termite colony slowly
gnawing our foundation as quietly as possible till they’ve done such work
that our house crumbles around us. My father has given Pliny the task of
eliminating the Sons. But Pliny has been failing. He will continue to fail
because the Sons of Ares are clever, and because my media adores giving
them attention. But when they become a thing so dreadful to the Society, to
the Sovereign, to my father, that the very machine of governance grinds to a
halt, I will step forward and say, ‘I will cure this disease in three weeks.’
And then I will, with my media, with the syndicates systematically killing
all the Sons, and with you gloriously beheading Ares himself.”
      “You want a figurehead.”
      “I am not glamorous. I do not inspire. You are like one of the Old
Conquerors. Charismatic and virtuous. When they look at you, they see
none of the soft decadence of our meager time, none of the political poison
that has saturated Luna since Lune’s family rose to power. They will look at
you and see a cleansing knife, a new dawn for a Second Golden Age.”
      Like father, like son. Both targeting the Sons of Ares in similar ways.
It’s chilling thinking of the war that will rage between crime syndicate
throat-cutters and Ares’s agents. It will destroy the Sons.
      “The Sons of Ares are only the beginning. A leverage point. You want
to rule.”
      “What other ambition is there?”
      “But not just Mars …”
      “Just because I’m small doesn’t mean my dreams have to be. I want it
all. And to get it, I’m willing to do anything. Even share.”
     “Perhaps you are not aware of what happened two months ago,” I say.
“Stop a Gold anywhere and ask. They’ll tell you what the Bellona family
did to the Reaper of Mars. I have no reputation. The only thing I inspire is
laughter.”
     “Cassius was shamed,” the Jackal says in irritation. “He was pissed on.
Beaten at the Institute. Embarrassed. Now he’s the deadliest dueler on
Luna. He fought any that would contest his worth. And now he’s
Sovereign’s favorite new pet. Did you know the old crow is making him an
Olympic Knight? Lorn au Arcos and Venetia au Rein both retired this year.
That means the posts of Rage Knight and Morning Knight are open.”
     “She’d make him one of the twelve?”
     “He is a piece on her board.” The Jackal leans forward. “But I tire of
playing pawn to my elders.”
     “As do I. Makes me feel like a Pink,” I say.
     “Then let us rise together. I the sceptre, you the sword.”
     “You won’t share. It’s not in your nature.”
     “I do what I need to do. No more. No less. And I need a warlord. I’ll
be Odysseus. You be Achilles.”
     “Achilles dies in the end.”
     “Then learn from his mistakes.”
     “It’s a good idea.” I pause at his spreading smile. “With one problem.
You are a sociopath, Adrius. You don’t only do what you need to do. You
wear whatever face you need, whatever emotion you desire like a glove.
How could I ever trust you? You killed Pax.” I let the words hang in the air.
“You killed my friend, your sister’s protector.”
     “Pax and I had never met before. All I saw was an obstacle in my path.
Of course I knew of the Telemanuses, but after Claudius got his brains
splattered everywhere, Father split Mustang and me up to protect us. Put me
in even greater isolation than her. I was his heir. I had no friends, only
tutors. He ruined my youth. And then he discarded me as he discarded you,
because we lost. You and I mirror one another.”
     A fight breaks out in the level above us. A scorcher cracks. Bouncers
rush upward, cradling their own weapons. Most of the patrons sit
undisturbed.
     “What of your sister?” I ask hesitantly, knowing deep down that I have
no other options left but this one.
       “Do you want to know how she fares?” he asks plainly. “Who shares
her bed? I can give you whatever answers you want. My eyes are
everywhere.”
       “I don’t want that.” I shake my head, trying to banish the dark idea of
someone sharing her bed. Of her finding joy in someone else, even if she
deserves to. Even stranger is thinking the Jackal knows these things. “Is she
involved in this?”
       “No,” the Jackal says with a heavy laugh. “You know she’s with Lune
now. It’s hilarious, really. Who would have thought that of the two of us,
she’d be the prodigal twin? Well, more prodigal.”
       “She cannot be hurt,” I say. “If she is, I will cut off your head.”
       “That’s aggressive. But you have a deal. So you are with me.”
       “I’ve been with you since I got in the shuttle. You know I have no
other options. And I know no other person would ever summon me here.
The variables could only lead to this end.” And why should they not?
       I took his hand, he took a friend. All he has done is bite and claw for
his own survival. Watching him now, so small and plain in a world of gods,
it’s almost as if he’s the hero nobly struggling against a father who rejected
him, against a Society that laughs at his size, his weakness, and scorns him
as a cannibal even though it was they who told him to do whatever he had
to do to win. In an odd way he is like me. He could have had his hand
repaired, but he chose not to, wearing it as a badge of honor instead of
shame.
       So I’ll go along with this. Then, in the end, I’ll kill him. For Pax.
       His face splits into a grand smile. “I’m so pleased, Darrow. So
pleased.”
       “But what is next?” I ask. “You must need something from me now.”
       “A Gold by the name of Fencor au Drusilla has learned of my …
dealings with the syndicates. He is trying to blackmail me. I need you to kill
him.”
       Of course. “When?”
       “Not for a week or so. The real purpose of killing him will be to gain
favor with one of the Sovereign’s cousins who was slighted by Fencor. With
Fencor’s death, you’ll fall into the cousin’s … favor.”
       I choke down a laugh. “You’ll have me play the role of a Pixie gallant,
flitting about court, bedding ladies?” Yet another role. Mustang will think
I’m doing it to spite her.
      The Jackal’s eyes sparkle with mischief. “Who said anything about
ladies?”
      “Oh,” I say, realizing what he means. “Oh, that’s … complicated.
Tactus might be better for this …”
      The Jackal chuckles at my surprise. “Oh, you’ll do just fine. But all
this is worry for another day. For now, relax. I’ll purchase your contract
through a second party as soon as it goes up for auction.”
      “The Bellona will try to buy it.”
      “I have a backer. We’ll outspend them.”
      “Victra?”
      “No. She’s more of a broker in this. What you have to understand
about Victra is she’s not … how do you say … partisan. She just loves
stirring the pot. The backer you’ll meet soon enough.”
      “That won’t work,” I say. “I want to meet him now. I’m not your
puppet. I share everything I know, you share everything you know.”
      “But I know so much more. Fine.” He leans forward. “You’ll meet him
tonight. It’s not that I don’t trust you. I just think it appropriate that he
introduces himself.”
      “Fine enough. I want to bring the Howlers back. And Sevro.”
      “Done. You’ll also need to select a blademaster, someone to tutor you
with the razor. We’ll need you to kill a few people publicly in the future.”
      “I know how to use a razor,” I say.
      “Not what I’ve heard. Come now, there’s no shame in it. I have a few
names. It’s a pity Arcos isn’t tutoring. These days I might actually have the
funds to afford Stoneside and his Willow Way …”
      His words trail off and his eyes drift from me, pulled to the slinking
form of a woman who cuts through the smoke and drab of the tavern like an
ember falling through fog. I can smell the almond on her skin. The citrus of
her lips as she nears our table, graceful and stirring as the air of Venus’s
Summer Coast. Bones fragile, avian. She wears a black shift that covers her
skin except her bare shoulders.
      Then I catch her eyes and I almost fall out of my chair. It’s a shot to
the heart. My pulse patters. It’s her. The girl with wings who could never
fly. But now … she’s fled from Mickey, it seems. Wings gone, ripened into
womanhood. But why is Evey here? Did the Sons send her? I can barely
keep my composure. She hasn’t recognized me.
      “I didn’t know Roses to grow so deep amongst the weeds,” the Jackal
says to her.
      Her laughter drifts like the beating of a butterfly’s wings. She traces
the bottom edge of the worn table and shrugs minutely.
      “Common men can’t afford uncommon things. But my mistress heard
uncommon men were in Lost City and sent me as an … ambassador.”
      “Ah …” The Jackal leans back, appraising her. “You’re a syndicate
girl. One of Vebonna’s?” Off her nod, the Jackal looks at me and mistakes
my expression of surprise for one of desire. “Take her upstairs, Darrow. On
me. A welcoming gift. Let me know if you want to buy her. We can discuss
business tomorrow.”
      At the word “Darrow,” Evey’s composure buckles for a blink. She
steps back and I hear her breath pattern change. And when her eyes meet
mine, I know she sees through the Obsidian disguise and glimpses the Red
underneath all these lies. However, the surprise there means she’s not here
for me. She’s here for the Jackal, but why? Is she with the Sons? Or did
Mickey finally sell his prize to this Vebonna gangster?
      “I don’t do slaves,” Evey says to the Jackal, pointing to my Obsidian
sigils.
      “You’ll find there’s more to this one than meets the eye.”
      “Dominus, I …”
      He grabs her hand, twisting her pinky horribly. “Shut up and do as
you’re told, girl. Or we’ll take what you won’t give.” He flashes a great
smile and releases her. She holds her hand, trembling. It doesn’t take much
to wound a Pink.
      I stand. “I believe I’ll take it from here, my friend.”
      “I’m sure you will!”
      I wave the bodyguards away who try to follow me as I stand.
      I follow Evey up the handrungs leading to the fourth floor, earning
hoots from some of the patrons. My eyes catch one of the holoCans above
the bar. Images of a bombing ripple in three dimensions. It looks to be at a
café. A Gold café. My eyes widen as the extent of the devastation is shown.
Was it the Sons?
      Another bombing flashes across a different screen. And another. And
another till dozens of bombings flood the screens throughout the tavern. All
heads turn to watch, silence yawning through the vast tavern. Evey’s hand
tightens around mine, and I know it was the Sons who committed the
bombings. They sent her. But why Luna? Why the Jackal? Why haven’t
they contacted me?
      “Hurry,” she says as we reach the fifteenth floor, pulling me through
the pink lights, past the dancers and hungry patrons to the last door at the
end of a narrow corridor. I follow her inside the dark room and immediately
smell the acrid tang of scorcher oil. Air shifts behind me as a man in a
ghostCloak creeps forward. It takes considerable effort to resist the impulse
to kill him.
      “He’s one of ours,” Evey snaps. She turns on the light. Six Reds in
heavy military tech decloak. They wear demonHelms with high-grade
optics. “Call in the skimmer.”
      “He’s not Adrius au Augustus,” one of them growls.
      “He’s a bloody Obsidian.”
      “Strange-looking one.” One of the Reds with the optics jumps back,
scorcher priming. “Bone density is Gold!”
      “Stop!” Evey shouts. “He’s a friend. Harmony has been looking for
him.”
      Not Ares or Dancer?
      “You weren’t here for me,” I say, eyeing their weapons. “You were
hunting.”
      She turns to me. “I’ll explain later, but we have to go.”
      “What did you do?” I ask as one of the Reds pulls out a plasmaTorch
and cuts a hole in the wall, opening the room up to the stink of the city.
Moist air rushes in and lights flood the room as a small dropship descends,
opening its side hatches parallel to the improvised door.
      “Darrow, there’s no time.”
      I grab her. “Evey, why are you here?”
      Her eyes flash with triumph. “Adrius au Augustus has murdered
fifteen of our brothers and sisters. I was sent to capture or kill him. I chose
the later. In twenty seconds, he’ll be ash.”
      I rip one of the Reds’ datapads off his arm and prime my concealed
gravBoots. Evey shouts at me. The boots whine mournfully as they lift me
into the air. I rip back the way we came, rupturing through the door instead
of opening it, flying down the hallway like a bat out of hell. I smash past a
dancer, careen over two Orange customers, and turn a razor-tight right angle
down over the railing toward the Jackal’s table as he finishes his liquor. His
Stained marks me, as do the Grays. Too slow.
     On the screens, over the bombings, the static crackles and a blood-red
helm burns.
     “Reap what you sow,” Ares’s voice growls from a dozen speakers.
     The table melts under the Jackal’s hand. Consumed by the bomb Evey
planted. The Stained throws the Jackal away from the table like a doll and
curls his titanic body around the mushrooming energy. His mouth moves in
a death whisper, “Skirnir al fal njir.”
9
The Darkness

      The energy blossoms outward from the Stained, liquid to the eye,
evaporating his body and spreading over the floor like spilled mercury
before darkening, slipping back to the origin, sucking men and chairs and
bottles toward it like a black hole before detonating with a deep, nightmare
roar. I snag the Jackal up by his jacket and fly through the wall, slamming
shoulder first as, behind us, glass, wood, metal, eardrums, and men rupture.
      My boots fail. We fly across the street and slam into the building
opposite, cracking concrete and falling to the ground as the Lost Wee Den
shrinks inward like a grape becoming a raisin becoming dust. She exhales a
death rattle of fire and ash before sagging to ruin.
      Beneath me, the Jackal’s unconscious, his legs badly burned. I vomit
as I try to stand, my skeleton creaking like the trunk of a young tree after its
first hard winter wind. I stumble up only to fall back to the ground,
emptying my stomach a second time. Pain in my skull. Nose dripping
blood. Ears trickling with it. Eyeballs throbbing from the explosion.
Shoulder dislocated. I gain my knees, wedge my shoulder against the wall
and roll the joint back in, quivering out breath as it pops into place. The
feeling of needles tickles my fingers. I wipe the sick off my hands and
wobble finally to my feet. I pick up the Jackal and squint into the smoke.
      I hear nothing but the wailing of stereocilia. Like screaming sparrows
in my inner ear, throbbing. I shake away the lights that dance across my
vision. Smoke swallows me. People flow past, water around a rock, rushing
to help those trapped. They’ll find only death, only ash. Sonic booms
puncture the night. The Jackal’s support teams roar down from the city
above. And as they land to take him out of this hell, the sparrows in my ears
fade, devoured by the crackling of flames and the crying of the wounded.
      I stand in front of an abandoned factory, four hundred kilometers from
the Citadel, deep in the Old Industrial Sector. Newer factories have been
built atop this one, burying it beneath a fresh skin of industry like a deep
blackhead. Grime skins the place. Carnivorous moss. Rust-filled water. I’d
have thought it a dead end if I didn’t know my quarry so well.
      The datapad I took from the Red survived the explosion. I left the
Jackal for his support teams and slipped further down the street, where I
stole a Gray police craft. After wiping the datapad’s tracking device, I
hacked into the datapad coordinates history.
      I knock hard on the locked door to the factory’s main level. Nothing.
They must be shitting themselves. So I kneel on the ground, hands behind
my head, and wait. After a few minutes, the door creaks open. Darkness
inside. Then several figures slip forward. They bind my hands, cover my
head with a bag, and push me into the factory.
      After taking me down an old hydraulic elevator, they guide me steadily
toward the sound of music. Brahms’s Piano Concerto no. 2, if I am correct.
Computers hum. Welding torches flare bright enough to glow through the
bag’s fabric.
      “Here, get off him, you brutes,” snaps a familiar voice.
      “Careful, clown,” rumbles some Red.
      “Babble at me all you want, you rusty baboon, he’s worth more than
ten thousand of you inbred rough—”
      “Dalo, get out,” Evey says softly. “Now.”
      Boots thud away. “Can I stop pretending now?” I ask.
      “By all means,” Mickey says.
      I snap the cuffs they bound my wrists with behind my back, and strip
off the bag that covers my head. The concrete and metal laboratory is clean,
quiet but for the soothing music. A faint haze floats in the air from
Mickey’s water pipe in the corner. I tower over him and Evey. She can’t
contain herself.
      No longer the seductress Rose from the tavern, she throws herself into
me like a little girl greeting a long-lost uncle. Her hands linger on my waist
as she eventually pulls back and stares up into my Gold eyes with her pink
ones. Despite her giggling, she’s all sensuality and beauty, with willowy
arms and a slow, intimate smile that echoes none of the grief killing nearly
two hundred people should mark her with. The winged girl has become a
carrion bird and she doesn’t seem to have noticed. I wonder if she’d smile
so broadly if she had to kill all those people with a knife. How easy we
make mass murder.
      “I could recognize you anywhere,” she says. “When I saw you at the
table … my heart skipped a beat. Especially in that ridiculous Obsidian
makeup. Darrow, what’s wrong?”
      She yelps when I pick her up by the front of her jacket and shove her
against the wall.
      “You just killed two hundred people.” I shake my head, sore and heavy
with the weight of what’s happened. “How could you, Evey?” I shake her,
seeing again the crew of my ship venting into space. Seeing all the dead
I’ve left in my path. Feeling Julian’s pulse fade to nothing.
      “Darrow, darling—” Mickey tries.
      “Shut up, Mickey.”
      “Yes. All right.”
      “Reds. Pinks. LowColors. Your own people. Like they were nothing.”
My hands tremble.
      “I was following orders, Darrow,” she says. “Adrius has been
investigating us. He had to be taken out.”
      So with all his scheming, he’d been noticed. Tears brim in Evey’s eyes.
I don’t recoil from them. Who gives a shit about how she feels after what
she’s just done? But I release her, letting her slide pathetically down the
wall, hoping she might show some glimmer of regret that would make me
think those tears are for the people she killed and not for herself, not
because she’s scared of me.
      “This isn’t how I wanted it to be,” she says, wiping her eyes. “When
you saw me again.”
      I stare down at her, confused. “What happened to you?
      “She had a different teacher than you,” Mickey says. “I took her wings
off and Harmony gave her claws.”
      I turn to Mickey. “What the hell is going on?”
      “It would take a year to explain.” He crosses his arms and examines
me. “But let us first say, you’ve been missed, my darling prince. Second,
please do not link my morality to that lost soul. I agree. Evey is a little
monster.” He glares past me at Evey as she stands. “Maybe now you’ll see
yourself for what you are.” His sneer fades, quick eyes scanning me toe to
head. “Third, you look divine, my boy. Absolutely divine.”
      His eyes dance over my face. His mouth opens, closes, tripping over
itself it has so much to say. Sharp of face, oily of hair, he slides forward like
a blade on ice. All angles. Skin wrapped around slender bones. Was he so
thin when last I saw him? Or does he simply not have his cosmetics? No.
His blinks are slow. Languid. He’s tired. Older. And seemingly beaten
down. A queer air of vulnerability in the way his shoulders hunch and his
eyes dart around, as if expecting to be hit at any moment.
      “I asked you a question, Mickey,” I say.
      “I can’t think about the forest! I’m still examining the tree! It’s
astounding how your body flourished. Simply astounding, my darling.
You’ve actually grown larger. How fare your pain receptors? Did the hair
follicles ever grow irritated as I was concerned? What about the muscle
contraction; do you find it above the average of your peers? Pupil dilation
fast enough? All I heard for months was talk of you on the HC. They could
not show the Institute, of course. But there were videos leaked on the
holoNet. Such videos—you killing a Peerless Scarred. Taking some strange
fortress in the sky, like a champion of old!”
      He grips my shoulder desperately, his hand weaker than I remember.
“Tell me about your life. What the Academy is like. Tell me everything. Are
you still lovers with that delectable Virginia au Augustus?” He frowns
suddenly. “Oh, of course you’re not. She’s with—”
      “Mickey.” I grip him. “Calm down.”
      He laughs so hard he coughs, turning from me to wipe his eyes. “Just
good to see a friendly face. They don’t allow me kind company these days.
None at all. Monstrous, really.”
      “Shut up, Mickey,” Evey snaps.
      His eyes slip to Evey, who now stands far from my reach, fingering the
burner holstered on her hip as though it would protect her from me.
      “Why are you on Luna? What is going on?” I ask. “Have you joined
the Sons?”
      “Much has happened,” Mickey murmurs. “I’m not here by—”
      “He works for us, now, Darrow,” Evey interrupts coldly. “Whether he
likes it or not. We took his little skin den apart. Used the funds he made
from selling flesh to buy transport here and equip an army. We’re striking
back, Darrow. Finally.”
      “One Pink terrorist and a handful of Reds playing with guns,” I say
without looking at her. “Is that your army?”
      “We drew blood from the Golds today, Darrow. If you don’t respect
me, respect that. I killed the son of Mars’s ArchGovernor. What have you
done that makes you think you can come here and spit on what we’ve
done?”
      “You didn’t kill him,” I say.
     She looks blankly at me. “Don’t be ridiculous.”
     I stare back, angry.
     “But how … The bomb …,” she says. “You’re lying.”
     “I got him out in time.”
     “Why?”
     “Because my mission is complicated. I need him. Where is Dancer?
Who is in charge here? Mickey—”
     “I am,” says another voice from my past, one with an accent like my
wife’s, except this voice is poisoned and bitter with anger. I turn to see
Harmony at the door. Half her face still blasted with that terrible scar. The
other half is cold and cruel, older than I remember.
     “Harmony,” I say mildly. The years have done nothing to warm us to
one another. “It’s good to see you. I need to debrief. There’s so much to
say.” I can’t even think where to begin. Then I notice the glance she gives
Evey. “Harmony, where is Dancer?”
     “Dancer is dead, Darrow.”
     Later, Harmony sits with me in front of Mickey’s desk in an office of
cheap, angular furniture and jars filled with hybrid organs floating in
preservative gas. Mickey sits behind the desk, fidgeting with that old
platonic puzzlecube of his. He sees me looking at it and he winks. He’s
gotten better. Evey leans against a barrel of chemicals. I sit, utterly lost.
Dancer had a plan for me. He had a plan for all this. He’s not supposed to
be dead. He can’t be.
     “It was Dancer’s last wish for Mickey to carve us a new army. One
that will rival the Golds in speed and strength. We’ve taken our greatest
men and women and put them to the carving. They cannot survive a Gold
procedure like the one you endured, but some manage to brave this new
program.” She waves out the glass where a hundred coffin-like tubes splay
across the floor. Inside each, Reds of a new breed. “Soon we’ll have a
hundred soldiers who can cut Gold deeper than any before.”
     As if a hundred would be enough to fight the Gold war machine. My
Howlers and I could likely shred any unit these terrorists put together. And
we’re not even the deadliest Golds.
     She gestures with a new arm, having lost the one of flesh and bone to
an Obsidian, when raiding an armory for weapons. It’s a limb of metal now.
Fluid and strong, with illegal blackmarket sockets for weaponry. Good
workmanship, but nothing compared with Mickey’s carving. Of course
she’d never let him work on her.
      “So Mickey is a prisoner?” I ask.
      “Slave, more like,” Mickey grunts with a small smile. “They don’t
even give me wine.”
      “Shut up, Mickey,” Evey snaps.
      “Evey.” Harmony fixes the young woman with a tolerant stare before
regarding Mickey. “Remember what we talked about, eh? Mind your
tongue.”
      Mickey flinches, eyes darting down to her left hand. There is an empty
holster on her belt. Something Mickey is scared of. Harmony is behaving
for me.
      “You afraid he’s going to say how you beat him?”
      She shrugs, dismissing my judgment. “Mickey sold girls and boys.
Can’t enslave a slaver. Far as I see it, he’s bloodydamn lucky not to have a
bullet in his brain. Could hire a Carver to give him horns and wings and a
tail so he’d look like the monster he is. But I haven’t. Have I, Mickey?”
      “No.”
      “No?”
      “No, domina.”
      The word makes me recoil in disgust.
      “Dancer always respected him,” I say. “I respect him, despite all his …
eccentricities.”
      “He bought people. Sold them,” Evey says.
      “We’ve all sinned,” I say. “Especially you, now.”
      “Told you he’d be bloodydamn holier than thou. Acting like he doesn’t
compromise his morality day in, day out. Finding excuses for wicked
bastards like our Mickey here.” Harmony smirks to Evey, sharing a private
joke. “That sort of attitude is all fine up there, Darrow. But you’ll learn we
don’t compromise here anymore. That’s the past.”
      “Then Dancer is truly dead.”
      “Dancer was a good man.” She’s silent for too short a moment for it to
count as respectful. “Half a year back, he hired a Gray mercenary team to
hit a communications hub so we could steal data. I said we should kill them
once the job was done. Dancer said … what was it again?… ‘We aren’t
devils.’ But after the Gray captain collected his pay, he pissed off to the
local Society Police headquarters and offered them Dancer’s location.
Bloodydamn lurcher squad put Dancer and two hundred Sons in the dirt in
two minutes. Never again. If they kill one of us, we kill a hundred of them.
And we don’t trust Grays. We don’t pay Violets. They’ve lived off our toil
for ages. We only trust Reds.”
      Evey shifts uncomfortably.
      “There was another Red at the Institute,” I say after a moment. “Titus.
Was he one of yours?” I glance toward Mickey.
      “Don’t look at me,” Mickey says.
      “How did you know Titus was a Red?” Harmony asks quickly. “Did he
tell you?”
      “He … let it slip. Small mannerisms. No one else noticed.”
      “Then you found each other?” she asks, not smiling, but sighing free a
weight she’s long carried. “He was a good lad. I’m sure you became
friends?”
      “He never discovered me. Did you carve him, Mickey?”
      With Harmony’s blessing, he answers. “No, darling. You were my
first. My only.” He winks. “I consulted on his carving. But an associate of
mine did his procedure based on the successes you and I pioneered.”
      “Dancer found you,” Harmony says. “I found Titus. Though his name
was Arlus, when we pulled him from Thebos mines. He didn’t care about
keeping it.”
      It’s fitting that Harmony would find Titus. Birds of a feather.
      “What happened to him?” she asks. “We know he died.”
      What happened to him? I let a Gold put him in the bloody ground.
      I look stonily at the three of them, thankful they cannot read my
thoughts. They know nothing. I can barely conceive of what they must
think of me. They’ve such small perspectives on what I’ve done, on what
I’ve become. I thought there was a plan, a long, large reason for all my toil.
But there was nothing. I know that now. Even Dancer was just waiting to
see what happened. Hoping.
      I expected to be welcomed back with open arms. I expected an army
waiting. A grand plan. For Ares to take off his infamous helm and dazzle
me with his brilliance and prove all my faith warranted. Hell, all I wanted
was to find them again so I would not feel alone. But I feel more alone than
ever sitting here in a concrete room with these three pale people on rickety
plastic chairs.
      “A Gold named Cassius au Bellona killed him,” I say.
     “Was it a good death?”
     “By now, you should know there’s no such thing.”
     “Cassius. The same one you have a bloodfeud with. Is that why?”
Evey asks eagerly. “Is that why the Bellona want to kill you?”
     I run a hand through my hair. “No. I killed Cassius’s brother. It’s one
of the reasons they hate me.”
     “Blood for blood,” Evey murmurs like she knows what the hell she’s
talking about.
     “We hit them hard today, Darrow. Twelve blasts across Luna and Mars.
Dancer and Titus have been avenged,” Harmony says. “And we’ll hit them
harder in the days to come. This cell is just one of many.”
     She waves her hand at the desk and scenes rise as the holoDisplay
comes to life. Violet news anchors drone on about the carnage.
     “Am I supposed to be impressed?” I ask. “You’re as bad as them. You
know that, yes? Never mind the strategy of it. Never mind you’re taunting a
sleeping dragon. Evey herself killed over a hundred lowColors just hours
ago.”
     “There weren’t Reds,” Harmony says, and then adds, in an amazingly
insincere afterthought, “or Pinks.”
     “Yes, there were!”
     “Then their sacrifice will be remembered,” Harmony says solemnly.
     “Vox clamantis in deserto,” I exclaim.
     Mickey sits quiet, but he allows himself a small smile.
     “Trying to impress us with your Gold fancy talk?” Harmony asks.
     “He feels like a voice crying out in the desert. Shouting all in vain,”
Mickey explains.
     “It’s simple Latin.”
     “So you know what’s what,” Harmony says. “Become a Gold and
suddenly you have all the answers.”
     “Wasn’t that the point of me becoming a Gold? So we could see how
they think?”
     “No. It was to position you to strike at their jugular.” She balls her fist
and strikes the palm of her metal hand in emphasis. “Don’t act like you
were born better. Remember, I know what you are inside. Just a scared boy
who tried to kill himself when he was too weak to save his wife from
hanging.”
     I sit stunned. Speechless.
      “Harmony, he’s just trying to help,” Evey says softly. “I know it must
be hard, Darrow. You’ve spent years with them. But we have to hurt them.
See, that’s all they understand. Pain. Pain is how they control us.”
      She continues slowly.
      “The first day I served a Gold was the greatest pleasure I felt in all my
life. I can’t explain it to you. It was like meeting God. Now I know that it
wasn’t pleasure I felt. It was the absence of pain.
      “That is how they train Pinks to live a life of slavery, Darrow. They
raise us in the Gardens with implants in our bodies that fill our lives with
pain. They call the device Cupid’s Kiss—the burn along the spine, the ache
in the head. It never stops. Not even when you close your eyes. Not when
you cry. It only stops when you obey. They take the Kiss away eventually.
When we’re twelve. But … you can’t know what it’s like, the fear that it’ll
come back, Darrow.”
      Evey plays with her nails. “Gold needs to feel pain. They need to fear
it. And they need to learn they may not hurt us without consequences.
That’s what Harmony means.”
      And I thought the Golds were broken. We’re all just wounded souls
stumbling about in the dark, desperately trying to stitch ourselves together,
hoping to fill the holes they ripped in us. Eo kept me from this end. Without
her, I’d be like them. Lost.
      “It’s not about hurting them, Evey,” I say. “It’s about beating them, Eo
taught me that, Dancer too. We’re swinging at the apples when we should
be digging at the roots. What will bombing them do? What will
assassination accomplish? We need to undermine their Society as a whole,
erode their way of life, not this.”
      “You’ve lost sight of your mission, Darrow,” Harmony says.
      “You say that to me?” I ask. “How could you possibly understand what
I’ve seen?”
      “Exactly. What you’ve seen. You dine with the masters, so you can
afford to live a life of theories. What about what I’ve seen? We’re down in
the shit. We’re dying. And what are you doing? Philosophizing. Living the
plush life. Bedding Pinks. I had to listen as Dancer died. I had to hear the
bloodydamn screams rattle over the coms as the lurchers came to kill. And I
could do nothing to save them. If you had lived through that, you would
know fire can only be fought with fire.”
      I know where these words lead. They gave me a hole in my gut. Put
me weeping in the mud, Cassius standing over me. That is how this will
end.
      “You may have lost all you love, Harmony. I’m sorry for that. But my
family is still in a mine. They will not suffer because you are angry. My
wife’s dream was about a better world. Not a bloodier one.” I stand. “Now,
I want to talk to Ares.”
      Silence lies heavy upon the room.
      “Give us a moment.” Harmony looks at Mickey and Evey. She
watches Mickey stand reluctantly. He pauses, as if to say something to me,
but, feeling Harmony’s eyes on him, thinks better of it.
      “Good luck, my darling,” he says simply, patting my shoulder.
      “Let me stay,” Evey says, drawing close to Harmony. “I can help with
him.”
      Harmony touches her hip. “Ares wouldn’t allow it.”
      “After what I did today … don’t you trust me? I’m not like the rest.”
      “I trust you, as much as any Red. But this is something I can’t share
with you.” She kisses Evey softly on the lips. “Go.”
      Evey pauses at the door, looking back at me. “We’re not your enemies,
Darrow. You have to know that.”
      The door clicks shut behind her and we’re left alone in Mickey’s
office.
      “Does she know?” I ask.
      “Know what?”
      “That you sent her on a suicide mission.”
      “No. She’s not like us. She trusts.”
      “And you’d sacrifice her?”
      “I’d sacrifice any of us to kill a Peerless Scarred. All we get are
worthless Pixies and Bronzies. I want the real tyrants.”
      “You’re using her worse than Mickey ever did.”
      “She has a choice,” Harmony mutters.
      “Does she?”
      “Enough.” Harmony sits and gestures for me to do the same. “Dancer
may be dead, but Ares has a plan for you.”
      “No. No. I’m done listening to his plans through others. I’ve sacrificed
three years of my life for him. I want to see his face.”
      “Impossible.”
      “Then I’m done.”
      “How can you be done, eh? You’re trapped. You bloodywell can’t go
home to Lykos, can you? One way out. Buckle tight and stay the course.”
      Her words strike hard. I can’t go back. The loneliness in that is
inexpressible. Where is my home? Where will I go even if this all ends with
Gold falling to ashes?
      “You won’t meet Ares. Even I’ve never even seen his face, Helldiver.”
      “You haven’t? You’ve worked for him almost as long as Dancer. Years.
How can you of all people trust him?”
      “Because he put the first gun in my hand. He wore his helmet and
pushed a mark IV scorcher with a full ion clip into my palm.”
      “Is Ares a man?” I ask.
      “Who cares?” She pulls up a holoDisplay. The electrons swirl in the
air, coalescing into a series of maps. I recognize the topography. Mars.
Venus. Luna, I think. Dozens of red dots blink throughout blueprints of
cities, dockyards, and a dozen other vital organs. Bombs, I realize.
Harmony looks tiredly at the map. “This is Ares’s plan. Four hundred
bombings. Six hundred assaults on weapons depots, government facilities,
electric companies, communications grids. It is the sum of the Sons of Ares.
Years of planning. Years of scraping up resources.”
      I had no idea we could carry out such action. I stare at the map in awe.
      “The bombings today were meant to provoke a response. Get them all
hot and bothered. We want them mobilizing. If they mobilize, they
condense. Easiest to burn pitvipers when they are packed tight.”
      “When will this take place?”
      “Three nights from now.”
      “Three nights,” I repeat. “At the conclusion of the Summit. He can’t
want me to do th—”
      “He does. Three nights from now, the Summit finishes up nice with a
gala. Wine, Pinks, silks, whatever the hell you Goldbrows do. All the
bloodydamn Governors, all the Senators, Praetors, Imperators, Judiciars
from across the Society will be here. A Solar System of monsters brought
by the power of the Sovereign to one place. It’ll be ten more years before
we see this. There’s no way for the Sons to get in, but you can go where we
can’t. You can strike the blow that we cannot.”
      I feel the words coming like a train down a tunnel.
      “When they have all gathered nice and tightlike. When the Sovereign
stands to give her speech, you kill the Goldbrow bastards with a radium
bomb we hide on you. Mickey and a crew of gizmos built the tech. Once we
see the bomb has detonated via the dataRecorder we’ll plant on you, we
unleash hell across the system. Burn them out.”
      This is the sum of all I’ve done?
      “There has to be another way.”
      “There were always two plans, Helldiver. This, and you. Ares and
Dancer said you were our hope, our chance at another path. They boasted
like boys that you could destroy Gold from inside. But you failed, like I
said you would. You’re gonna claim blood is on Evey’s hands. Well, it’s on
yours too.”
      “You don’t even know the blood I have on my hands, Harmony. I’m
not some bloodydamn saint. But Evey’s attack was a crime.”
      “The only crime is if we lose.”
      I shatter. “There’s more at play here than you understand. We cannot
face Gold. No matter the blow we strike, they will eradicate us like this.” I
snap my fingers.
      “So you won’t do it.”
      “No, I won’t do it, Harmony.”
      “Then the war begins without your help,” she says. “We had two Sons
ready to try to enter the gala. They are not Gold, so bets are higher they’ll
get caught and cut to ribbons in a Praetorian torture cell before completing
their mission. Means the leaders of Gold will live on, and our tiny chances
of winning this shitstorm shrink, because you don’t trust Ares.”
      “Slag this. Ares should have told me this himself if he wanted my
help!”
      “How? He is on Mars preparing the revolution. There is no way to
communicate. They monitor everything. How could he contact you without
exposing your cover?” She leans forward, lower teeth exposed ferally. “Tell
me, Darrow. Do you even know how much they’ve stolen from you?”
      It’s something in her tone. “What do you mean?”
      “Here’s what I mean.” She jams a series of orders into the holoCube
and an image appears of Lykos mines. My blood goes cold. “The recording
of Eo’s death, the one we pirated and broadcast …”
      My heart thuds in my throat.
      “It wasn’t complete.” She presses play and the room around us
becomes the mine. We’re a part of the three-dimensional holo. It’s the raw
footage, not the stuff on the newsreels, not the stuff I’ve seen a hundred
times. It shows the hanging without a soundtrack.
      I hear my own cries of pain as the Grays beat the boy I used to be.
Weeping in the crowd. The awkward silence of unedited footage. My
mother hangs her head and Uncle Narol spits in the dust. Kieran, my
brother, covers his children’s eyes. Feet shuffle. Dio, Eo’s sister, stumbles
up the metal scaffold. Shoes scraping over rust. Sobbing. Then Dio leans
toward my wife. Eo stands small, so pale and thin, little more than the
smoke of the burning girl I remember. Her lips move. Again, I don’t hear it,
just as I didn’t hear it that day. Suddenly Dio sobs uncontrollably and clings
to Eo. What was said?
      “Use the equipment. That’s what it’s there for, eh?”
      I’ve wondered it a thousand times but never had access to this footage.
I never knew how I’d find it without raising suspicion. And the thought
scared me, as it scares me now—what was I not strong enough to hear?
What could Dio bear that I could not?
      In the news footage that was pirated, they don’t even show Dio. But
here, with the raw footage, I can rewind. I do so. I can amplify the sound. I
do so. I watch it happen again: My mother hangs her head. Narol spits.
Kieran covers the children’s eyes. Feet shuffle. Dio goes up the scaffold.
All the sound is magnified. I sort out the white noise with the controls, and I
hear what my wife said to Dio.
      “In our bedroom, there is a crib I made. Hide it before Darrow
returns.”
      “A crib …,” Dio murmurs.
      “He must never know. It would break him.”
      “Don’t say it, Eo. Don’t.”
      “I am with child.”
10
Broken

      I break.
      Sitting in a void. Staring at my hands. The hands that could not save
my wife, my child. She was right. I wasn’t strong enough to bear the truth
of Eo’s second sacrifice. Eo could have lived. Eo could have given us the
child we always wanted. That future wasn’t worth her silence. I wasn’t
worth it …
      I feel something deep in my chest, a hollow raw ache. Like blackness
has opened in the pit of my soul even as my body tightens and coils around
grief. I weigh a million pounds. Shoulders slump. Chest compressed. My
fingers clutch together. Funny to think these hands have been with me this
whole time. They helped pull her ankles. They buried her in the soil. But
they didn’t just bury her, did they?
      No. They buried another life. One unborn. Our child, dead before it
lived. And I never even knew. I failed them both. The amplified video
replays again.
      “I am with child,” she tells Dio on the scaffold. “I am with child.”
      I replay it a dozen times, feeling myself shrink into a corridor of grief.
      The Golds didn’t just kill her. They killed what I’ve always wanted to
be—a husband and a father. If only I had stopped her. If only I had not
pouted like a child when we lost the Laurel, she wouldn’t have thought to
take me to the garden. If only I had the strength to pretend losing the Laurel
didn’t bother me.
      All the family I could have had. A wife. Sons. Daughters.
Grandchildren. They’ve been slaughtered before they ever were. Eo will
never hold our daughter. She will never kiss our son to sleep and smile over
at me as his little hands clutch my finger. I’m all that’s left of that family
that could have been. A dark shadow of the man I was meant to be.
      The rage rises. We had a chance, and it is gone. Everything I wanted is
gone, because of me and because of them. Their laws. Their injustice. Their
cruelty. They made a woman choose death for her and her unborn child over
a life of slavery. All that for power. All that so they can keep their perfect
little world.
       “You were not strong enough then,” Harmony says. “Are you strong
enough now, Helldiver?” I look at her, tears making warm paths down my
face. Her hard eyes soften for me. “I had children, once. Radiation ate their
insides, and they didn’t even give them pain meds. Didn’t even fix the leak.
Said there weren’t enough resources. My husband just sat there and
watched them die. In the end, the same thing took him. He was a good man.
But good men die. To free them, to protect them, we must be savages. So
give me evil. Give me darkness. Make me the bloodydamn devil if we can
bring even the faintest ray of light.”
       I stand and wrap my arms around her as I’m reminded of the true
horrors our kind face. Had I really forgotten? I am a child of hell, and I’ve
spent too long in their heaven.
       “Whatever Ares wants, I’ll do it.”
       “Pliny sent the bitch,” the Jackal hisses as the Yellow physicians
slowly remove the burned skin from his arm and reapply new growth
cultures. “It wasn’t Sons of Ares. They wouldn’t kill that many lowColors.
It’s against profile. Pliny probably. Or the Sovereign’s Praetorians using
cover.”
       The lights of passing ships glow through the glass. He curses and
shouts at his servants to black out the windows. Grays brought me here to
his private skyscraper instead of the Citadel, as I requested. The place
crawls with mercenaries. He prefers Grays to Obsidians, except apparently
that Stained. I’m the only other Gold, which shows the extent of the
Jackal’s trust. His name would certainly bring enough hangers-on to fill a
city, but he’s comfortable in his isolation. Like me.
       “Could it have been Victra?” I ask. “She didn’t stay …”
       “She’s already proven her loyalty. She wouldn’t use a bomb. And she’s
in love with you. It wasn’t her.”
       “In love with me?” I ask, startled.
       “You’re blind as a Blue.” He snorts but says no more about it. “Our
alliance must remain a secret until we’re off this damn moon, which means
you were not in that tavern. If Pliny knew the extent of our plans, he would
have been more thorough. I believe he was only targeting me. So you will
return to the Citadel. Pretend as if nothing has happened. I will continue my
plan with the syndicate lords, then purchase your contract at the end of the
Summit.”
      At which point, their world will change.
      I turn to leave him, but his voice arrests me at the door. “You saved my
life. Only one other person has ever done that. Thank you, Darrow.”
      “Tell your new skin to grow faster. You won’t want to miss the closing
gala.”
      The next three days pass in a haze, my mind on Eo and what we lost. I
cannot find escape from the grief. It plagues me even as I work myself to
death in the estate’s gymnasium. I do not indulge in small talk. I pull back
from my friends. None of this matters. Not to me. Life fades in the presence
of pain. Theodora notices, and tries her best to relieve my dourness, even
suggesting I distract myself with Roses from the Citadel’s Garden.
      “Better you, dominus, than some rough man from the Gas Giants,” she
says.
      News of the bombings sweeps through the Citadel, dominating the
news. The Society plays it well—broadcasting their aid relief. Sending out
instructions on how to handle a potential crisis. Yellow psychologists
analyze Ares on screen, conclude that a latent sexual trauma in his youth
makes him lash out to seize control of his world again. Violet actors and
entertainers raise money for those families who have lost loved ones.
Quicksilver himself volunteers three percent of his personal fortune to relief
efforts. Obsidian and Gray commandos attack asteroid bases where Sons of
Ares “train.” Gray antiterrorist agents hold press conferences saying they
have apprehended those responsible, likely some Reds they pulled out of a
mine or Luna’s slums.
      It’s a farce and the Golds play it so well. They hide from the cameras
and make this seem a fight of all the Colors against Red terrorists. This is
not Gold’s fight. It belongs to all of Society. Moreover, Society is winning
because our sacrifice and obedience allow us to prosper. Bloodydamn
horseshit.
      Yet still, blame must be placed. So the ArchGovernor is pulled away to
face inquiries regarding his handling of the situation. How have the Sons
spread from Mars to Luna? they will ask. The Gold hornets’ nest has been
stirred, as I said it would be, but still the gala continues. I watch the Golds
play their games of intrigue, diplomacy, spiriting off to galas and
conferences and summits, untouched by the dirty games with terrorists.
They are protected, shielded from horror.
      It would bother me, but they are shadows to me now. As though
they’ve already fallen into memory. This present is pale compared to my
past.
      I touch the bomb on my chest in regret. It is of Mickey’s make. A copy
of the pegasus I wore at the Institute, which contained Eo’s hair and now
lies secreted away with my other personal effects. All I need do is twist its
head and it becomes the bomb. The ring they gave me will activate it.
      I draw away from friends, from Victra. She’s asked Roque what is
wrong with me. I know he will answer that I’m like the wind, a creature of
vagary and moods. Or something like that. He draws closer to me, visiting
my rooms when I’ve gone to bed, attempting to spar with me in the
gymnasium. But I cannot smile with him or listen to his soft voice read
poems or discuss philosophy or even share jokes. I can’t let myself feel for
him, because I know he will soon be dead. I try to kill him in my heart
before I kill him in the flesh.
      Can I add him to the list of those I’ve already sent to the grave?
      I finally find my answer the night of the gala, when Theodora brings
me my pressed clothing from the laundry. She doesn’t say anything that
reminds me of Roque. Doesn’t offer pithy wisdom. Instead, she does
something I’ve never seen from her. She makes a mistake. While setting my
uniform down on a chair, she knocks over a glass of wine on a nearby table.
The wine splashes over the sleeve of my white uniform. What flashes
through her eyes chills me—terror. The sort a deer might have when staring
at an oncoming aircar. She streams out apologies as though I would hit her
if she did not. It takes her a moment to compose herself, for the flash of
panic to dissipate. When it does, she sits there on the floor, dabbing at the
uniform in silence.
      I don’t know what to do. I stand there awkwardly for a moment before
putting a hand on her shoulder to tell her all’s well. That’s when she begins
to cry in great heaving sobs that rack her small shoulders. She flinches from
my touch and composes herself, telling me I’ll have to wear black instead
of white. She may not know what is about to happen, but she can feel it in
me, in the air.
      While the other lancers play with each other, take microabrasion baths,
and consult with stylists to prepare themselves for the gala, I lace up my
thick military boots with trembling fingers. I’ve never been good at saving
my friends. It seems I always drag them into harm’s way. Sevro, I believe,
is only still alive because of the distance between us. Fitchner was always
afraid I’d kill his son. Said my life’s strand was so strong that it frayed all
those around it. Now, seeing Theodora like that … it reminds me how
fragile and complicated we really are. I don’t know why she cried. Some
past trauma? Some sense of what’s to come? Not knowing reminds me of
the depth to the people around me. I am speechless, cold, but Roque is
warm … he would have known what to say.
      I knock on his door several minutes before Augustus’s entourage is set
to depart the villa for the gala. There is no answer. I open the door and find
my friend sitting on his bed, holding an ancient book gently by its spine.
His smooth features ripple into a smile when he sees it is me.
      “I thought you were Tactus come to beg me to shoot some stims before
the gala. He always thinks because I’m reading, I’m not doing anything.
There is no greater plague to an introvert than the extroverted. Especially
that beast. He will run himself into the ground one of these days.”
      I force a chuckle. “At least he’s sincere about his vices.”
      “Have you met his brothers yet?” Roque asks. I shake my head. “They
make Tactus look like a lamb.”
      “Goryhell,” I swear. I lean against the door’s frame. “That bad?”
      “The Rath brothers? They are terrible. Terribly rich. Terribly talented.
And their chief virtue lies in their ability to sin. They’re prodigies at it.”
Roque grins conspiratorially. “If you believe rumors—and I love rumors,
remind me of Byron and Wilde—Tactus’s brothers opened a brothel in
Agea when they were fourteen. Classy affair till they started arranging more
… customized experiences.”
      “Then what happened?”
      “Ruined daughters, sons. Insults. Duels. Dead heirs. Debt. Poison.” He
shrugs. “It’s the Rath family. What do you expect from those blackguards?
It’s why everyone was so surprised Tactus had taken up with an Iron Gold
like you,” he clarifies. “You know his brothers mock him for being in your
shadow. It’s why he’s always so sarcastic. He wants to be like you, but he
can’t. So he resorts to his usual defenses.” He frowns. “Sometimes I feel
like you understand all of us better than we understand ourselves. Then
other times, it’s like you could care less.” Roque tilts his head at me when I
say nothing. “What is it?”
      “Nothing.”
      “You’re never one for nothing.” He sets his book down on his chest
and pats the edge of the bed, drawing me into the room. “Sit, please.”
      “I came because I wanted to apologize,” I say very slowly, sitting on
the edge of the bed. “I’ve been distant these last months, particularly these
last days. I don’t think I was fair to you. Not when you’ve been my most
loyal friend. Well, you and Sevro, but he won’t stop sending me strange
pictures over the net.”
      “More unicorns?”
      I laugh. “I think he has a problem.”
      Roque pats my hand. “Thank you. But you’re like a hound apologizing
for wagging its tail. You’re always distant, Darrow. You don’t have to
apologize for how you are, not to me.”
      “More distant, perhaps?”
      “Perhaps,” he agrees, allowing it. “We all have our own tides inside us.
They go in. Out.” He shrugs. “Not really ours to control. The things, people,
that orbit us do that, at least more than we’d like to admit.” After watching
me a moment, he furrows his brow in thought. “Is this about Mustang? I
know it was hard for you to leave her, no matter what you said at the time.
You should seek her out while we’re here. I know you miss her.”
      “I don’t.”
      “Liar, liar, cheeks afire.”
      “I’ve told you a hundred times, we’re not talking about her.”
      “Fine. Fine. Then you’re worried, aren’t you? About the auction?” He
pauses, smiling and watching me. “You shouldn’t. I’ve settled that matter.
I’m going to bid on you.”
      “You don’t have the money,” I say flatly.
      “Do you know how badly a Pixie would pay to get a Peerless with my
pedigree and connections in their debt? Millions. I could even go to
Quicksilver if I need. He loans to Golds all the time. Point is, I’ll have the
money, even if my parents won’t help me. So never you worry, brother.” He
pokes me with his foot. “House Mars has to mean something, eh?”
      “Thank you,” I say, stuttering out the words, unable to really grasp
what he’s done. And why? It puts his neck out. It endangers him and
crosses his parents. “No one else has even mentioned the auction to me.”
      “They’re afraid your bad luck is contagious. You know how it is.” He
pauses, waiting because he knows me so well. “There’s something else.
Isn’t there?”
      I shake my head. “Do you …” My words fail me. “Do you ever feel
lost?” The question hangs between us, intimate, awkward only on my end.
He doesn’t scoff as Tactus and Fitchner would, or scratch his balls like
Sevro, or chuckle like Cassius might have, or purr as Victra would. I’m not
sure what Mustang might have done. But Roque, despite his Color and all
the things that make him different, slowly slides a marker into the book and
sets it on the nightstand beside the four-poster, taking his time and allowing
an answer to evolve between us. Movements thoughtful and organic, like
Dancer’s were before he died. There’s a stillness in him, vast and majestic,
the same stillness I remember in my father.
      “Quinn once told me a story.” He waits for me to moan a grievance at
the mention of a story, and when I don’t, his tone sinks into deeper gravity.
“Once, in the days of Old Earth, there were two pigeons who were greatly
in love. In those days, they raised such animals to carry messages across
great distances. These two were born in the same cage, raised by the same
man, and sold on the same day to different men on the eve of a great war.
      “The pigeons suffered apart from one another, each incomplete
without their lover. Far and wide their masters took them, and the pigeons
feared they would never again find one another, for they began to see how
vast the world was, and how terrible the things in it. For months and
months, they carried messages for their masters, flying over battle lines,
through the air over men who killed each other for land. When the war
ended, the pigeons were set free by their masters. But neither knew where
to go, neither knew what to do, so each flew home. And there they found
each other again, as they were always destined to return home and find,
instead of the past, their future.”
      He folds his hands gently, a teacher arriving at his point. “So do I feel
lost? Always. When Lea died at the Institute …” His lips slip gently
downward. “… I was in a dark woods, blind and lost as Dante before Virgil.
But Quinn helped me. Her voice calling me out of misery. She became my
home. As she puts it, ‘Home isn’t where you’re from, it’s where you find
light when all grows dark.’” He grasps the top of my hand. “Find your
home, Darrow. It may not be in the past. But find it, and you’ll never be lost
again.”
      I’ve always thought of Lykos as my home. Of Eo as my home. Perhaps
that’s where I’m going now. To see her. To die and find home again in the
Vale with my wife. But if that’s true, why am I not full? Why does the
hollowness grow inside me the closer I draw to her?
      “It’s time to go,” I say, rising from the bed.
      “As sure as I am your friend”—Roque begins to rise as well—“you
will recover from this. We are not our station in life. We are us—the sum of
what we’ve done, what we want to do, and the people who we keep close.
You’re my dearest friend, Darrow. Mind that. No matter what transpires, I
will protect you as surely as you would protect me if ever I needed it.”
      I surprise him by clasping his hand and holding it for a moment.
      “You’re a good man, Roque. Far too good for your Color.”
      “Thank you?” He squints at me as I release his hand and he straightens
the wrinkles in his uniform. “But whatever do you mean by that?”
      “I think we could have been brothers,” I say. “Were this a different
life.”
      “Why do we need another life?” Then he sees the automatic syringe in
my left hand. His hands are too slow to stop me, but his eyes are quick
enough to widen in trusting fear, like a loyal dog’s as he’s put slowly to
sleep in its master’s lap. He doesn’t understand, but he knows there’s a
reason, yet still comes the fear, the betrayal that breaks my heart into a
thousand pieces.
      The syringe pierces Roque’s neck and he sinks slowly down onto the
bed, eyes drifting closed. When he wakes, everyone he has worked with and
for over these past two years will be dead. He will remember what I did to
him after he said I was his closest friend. He will know that I knew what
was going to happen at the gala. And even if I don’t die tonight, even if they
do not discover I was the bomber by other merits, saving Roque’s life
means I will be found out. There is no going back.
11
Red

      Tonight, I kill two thousand of humanity’s great. Yet I walk with them
now, untouched by decadence and condescension as never before. Pliny’s
arrogance raises none of my blood. Victra’s immodest dress does not
disconcert me, not even when she slips her arm in mine after Tactus offers
her his. She whispers in my ear how silly she is for forgetting her
undergarments. I laugh like it’s a merry joke, trying to mask the coldness
that’s taken me over.
      This is static.
      “I suppose Darrow deserves some consolation before he leaves,”
Tactus says with a sigh. “Have you seen Roque, my goodman?”
      “Said he was feeling ill.”
      “That’s very Roque of him. Likely coiled around a book. I should fetch
him.”
      “If he wanted to come, he would come,” I say.
      “I want him to come,” Tactus replies. He shrugs at the other lancers
who jockey for position close to our master.
      “If you need him so badly, go fetch him,” I say, tactically.
      He flinches. “I need no one on my arm. But if I didn’t know better, I’d
think you’re still bitter about the whole escape-pod affair.”
      “You mean when you launched it without him?” Victra asks. “Why
would that ever bother him?”
      “I thought he was dead! It was simple calculation.” He bumps my
shoulder with his fist and nods to Victra. “You understand. Had to watch out
for the lady here.”
      “She is a delicate little flower,” I say, pulling her away.
      “Woe for the lone god of the sea,” Tactus hums melodically. “His
friends, like mine, abandoned he!”
      Victra adjusts the gold pauldron on her shoulder, which winds its way
down her arm in a series of golden cuffs. “That darling boy is so vain he
could make a thunderstorm be about him.” She notices my lack of care.
“The bidding won’t begin till after the gala.” She nods to a landing aircar.
“Well, I was wondering when he’d show.”
       The Jackal exits the car, skin faintly pink only in patches. His Yellows
did him well. He bows faintly to his father, ignoring the murmurs of the
aides.
       “Father,” he says, “I thought it fitting if the Family Augustus arrived at
the gala with at least one of your children. We must present a united front,
after all.”
       “Adrius.” Augustus eyes his son for something to criticize. “I wasn’t
aware you enjoyed banquets these days. I’m not sure the fare will be to your
liking.”
       The Jackal laughs theatrically. “Perhaps that is why my invitation was
not delivered! Or was it the furor over the terrorist attacks? No matter. I am
here now, and ever eager to attend your side.” The Jackal falls in, smiling
broadly to all, knowing his father will never escalate family quarrels in
public. He offers me a particularly sinister sneer, one others see and shrink
away from. All stage. “Shall we?”
       I mind myself and say little as I follow with Victra at the end of the
long procession that snakes its way through labyrinthine marble halls from
our villa to the Citadel Gardens some two kilometers distant. The
Sovereign’s tower juts from the floor of the garden there, a grand, two-
kilometer-high sword piercing a groomed garden thick with rose trees and
streams.
       Water runs through the garden in a thousand winding paths. Babbling
brooks with colored fish lead to quiet lagoons where carved Pink mermaids
swim under flowering trees crawling with monkeycats. Rangy tigerlynx
lounge below the boughs. Violets wander through these bright woods,
flitting here and there like summer moths, their violins echoing in eerie
concert. It is a picture of Bacchus’s night gardens without the obscene
sexuality the Greeks found so hilarious—Pixies would chuckle at that smut,
but Peerless do not. At least, not in public.
       We glimpse other processions through the trees. See their standards,
great flashing things of moving fabric and metal. Our red and gold lion
crest roars in silent challenge. A raven on a field of silver marks the passing
of the Family Falthe over a cobblestone bridge. We eye their lord and his
lancers warily. As a matter of course, all carry razors, but other tech is
forbidden—no datapads, no gravBoots, no armor. This is a classical affair.
      The tower yawns above us. Purple, red, and green mosses climb the
base of the great structure with vines of a thousand hues, wrapping the glass
and stone like the fingers of greedy bachelors around the wrist of a rich
widow. Six great lifts bear families skyward to the top of the tower.
      Beautiful Pink servants and Brown footmen service the lift, all in
white. Gold triangles of the Society decorate their livery.
      The lift is flat, marble with gravthrusters. It sits in the middle of a
clearing where green grass flutters in the wind. Several Coppers rush
forward to talk with Pliny, who, as Politico, speaks on behalf of the
ArchGovernor. There seems to be some confusion. The Falthe family files
into the lift ahead of us.
      “This is a social trap,” Augustus mutters back to his favorite ward.
Leto draws closer. “The fools. See how they feign accident. Soon they will
tell us we must use the lift with the Falthes, when instead they should
grovel to have us go before them.”
      “Could it not be an accident?” Leto asks.
      “Not on Luna.” Augustus crosses his arms. “Everything is politics.”
      “The winds shift.”
      “They’ve been shifting for some time now,” Augustus murmurs. His
sharp face surveys his aides, as if making an accounting of the razors we
carry. Some wear them coiled at their sides. Others wear them around their
forearms like I do with my borrowed blade. Tactus and Victra each use
them as sashes.
      “I want three lancers attending the ArchGovernor at all times,” Leto
announces quietly. We nod, the pack tightening. “No drinking.”
      Tactus moans in protest.
      Expressionless, the Jackal watches Leto give orders.
      Pliny returns from speaking with the Citadel staff. Sure enough, we’re
to share the lift with the Falthes. But something more menacing fills the air.
Our Obsidians and Grays are to be left behind. “All families are to proceed
to the gala without attendants,” he says. “No bodyguards.”
      Murmurs go through our ranks.
      “Then we won’t go,” the Jackal says.
      “Don’t be a fool,” Augustus replies.
      “Your son is right,” Leto says. “Nero, the danger …”
      “Some invitations are more dangerous to decline than to accept.
Alfrún, Jopho.” Augustus makes a cutting motion to his Stained. The two
men nod silently and join the others to the side. Genuine emotion fills their
eerie eyes, worry, as we join the Falthes on the lift and ascend. The head of
the Falthe house smiles. His station improves.
      The gala upon the roof of the Sovereign’s tower is modeled as a winter
fairyland. Snow falls from invisible clouds. It dusts the spearlike pines of
manmade forests and frosts my short hair with snowflakes that taste like
cinnamon and orange. Breath billows in front of me.
      The ArchGovernor’s appearance is noted with trumpet calls. Tactus
and some of the younger lancers cut the Falthes off, obstructing their path
so Augustus can enter the gala first. A body of pale gold and bloody red, we
move into a grand landscape of evergreens. The pride of Gold culture
awaits us. A terrible sea of faces that have seen things the first men could
never even dream. You can see glimmers of our shared past at the Institute.
The charmers of Apollo. The killers of Mars. The beauties of Venus.
      Beneath the spire, the Citadel sprawls, and beyond those grounds
glisten the cities with all their million lights. You would never guess that
beneath that sea of twinkling jewels lurks a second city of filth and poverty.
Worlds within worlds.
      “Try not to lose your head,” Victra whispers to me, raking a clawed
hand through my hair before going to speak with friends of hers from Earth.
      I walk toward our table. Great chandeliers hover overhead on small
gravthrusters. Light sparkles. Dresses move like liquid around perfect
human forms. The Pinks serve delicacies and spirits on plates and in goblets
of ice and glass.
      Hundreds of long tables spread concentrically around a frozen lake at
the center of the winter land. The Pinks wear skates to serve here. Beneath
the ice, shapes move. Not sexualized perversities as one would find
entertaining Pixies and lowColors. But mystical creatures with long tails
and scales that glitter like the stars. In another life, it would have been
Mickey’s dream to have a creature commissioned for this feast. I smile to
myself. I suppose in a way he already has.
      The tables are neither named nor numbered. Instead, we find our place
as we see a great lion seated upon the center of our table, nearly motionless.
Each family’s table is so claimed by their sigil. There are griffins and
eagles, ice fists and huge iron swords. The lion purrs contentedly as Tactus
steals a serving tray of appetizers from a Pink and sets it between the
beast’s massive paws. “Eat, beast! Eat!” he cries.
      Pliny finds me. His hair is bound behind him in a tight, complicated
braid. His clothing, for once, is as severe as his pointed nose, like he means
to impress the Peerless about him with his hawkish features and sparse
accoutrements. “I’ll be introducing you to several interested parties later in
the evening. When I signal for you, I expect you to join me.” He looks
around distractedly, seeking important persons for his own aims. “Till then,
cause no trouble and mind your manners.”
      “No trouble.” I take out my pegasus pendant. “On my family’s honor.”
      “Yes,” he says without looking. “And what a noble family it is.”
      I gaze around the gala. Hundreds mill about already, with more
arriving by the minute. How long should I wait? It is difficult to hold on to
the rage that made me embrace this decision. They killed my wife, I tell
myself. They killed my child. But no matter the anger I summon by
reminding myself, I cannot burn away the fear that I steer the rebellion
toward a cliff.
      This will not be for Eo’s dream. It will be for the satisfaction of those
living. To sate their lust for vengeance rather than honoring those who have
already sacrificed everything. And it will be irreversible. But so is the
course that has been set.
      So many doubts. Is this me being a coward?
      I’m thinking too much. That makes a bad soldier. And that is what I
am. A soldier for Ares. He gave me this body. I should trust him now. So I
take the pegasus and slap it on the underside of Augustus’s table, just near
the table’s end.
      “A toast?” someone says. I turn and find myself face-to-face with
Antonia. I’ve not seen her since the Institute, when Sevro pulled her down
from the cross she was nailed to by the Jackal. I flinch away, mind flashing
to the night she cut Lea’s throat, all to draw me out of the dark.
      “I thought you were on Venus studying politics,” I say.
      “We’ve graduated,” she replies. “I did enjoy your christening. Watched
it several times with my friends. Odious scent, urine.” She sniffs me. “Hard
to get out.”
      Nature was cruel to make her so terribly beautiful. Full lips, legs
nearly as long as mine, skin smooth as butter, and hair like spun golden
yarn from that storybook about the princess of cinders. All a mask for the
wretched creature beneath. “I can tell you missed me while I was away.”
She hands me a goblet of wine. “So let us toast to good reunion.”
      It makes little sense to me that we live in a world where she can stand
here weaving her evil webs when my wife is dead, when kind Golds like
Lea and Pax have been ground to ash and shot into the sun.
      “Fitchner once said something to me, Antonia. It seems appropriate
now.” I raise my goblet in a polite toast.
      “Oh, Fitchner,” she sighs, her breasts rising aggressively from her too-
tight golden dress. “The bronze rodent has been making a name for himself
here. Whatever did he say?”
      “‘A man can never miss chlamydia.’” I dump the wine out in front of
her and push past. She grabs my arm and pulls me back to her, bringing me
close enough that I feel the heat of her breath. “They’re coming,” she says.
“The Bellona are coming for you. You should run now.” She looks at my
razor. “Unless you think you’re good enough with that to beat Cassius in a
duel?” She releases me. “Good luck, Darrow. I will miss having an ape at
the ball. More than Mustang will, at least.”
      I pay no attention to her words and wander away, willing more houses
to fill the gala so that I may end this soon. A host of Praetors, Quaestors,
Judiciars, Governors, Senators, family heads, house leaders, traders, two
Olympic Knights, and a thousand others come to bid my master a good
evening. These older men talk of Outrider attacks on Uranus and Ariel, a
foolish rumor of a new Rage Knight already gaining the armor, mysterious
Sons of Ares bases on Triton, and a resurgent strain of plague on one of
Earth’s dark continents. Light fare.
      Many others take my master aside, as though a hundred eyes did not
watch their every move, and with voices like syrup, tell him of whispers in
the night, of shifting winds and dangerous tides. The metaphors mix. The
point is the same. Augustus has fallen out of favor with the Sovereign the
same way I have fallen out of favor with him.
      The ships flitting above in the night sky are as distant from the
conversation as I. My attention has fallen upon the Sovereign herself. How
strange a thing, to see the woman just there beyond the dance floor, at the
raised podium, speaking with other house lords and men who rule the lives
of billions. So close, so human and frail.
      Octavia au Lune stands with her coterie of women, the three Furies—
sisters she trusts above all others. For her part, the Sovereign is more
handsome than beautiful, face impassive as a mountain’s. Her silence is her
power. I see her speech is seldom, but she listens; always, she listens to
words as the mountain listens to the whispering and screaming of wind
through its crags, around its peaks.
      I see a man standing alone near a tree. He’s near as thick around as its
trunk. A hand dwarfs his small goblet, and he wears the mark of a sword
with wings, a Praetor with a fleet. I approach him. He sees me coming and
smiles.
      “Darrow au Andromedus,” Karnus growls.
      I snap my fingers at a passing Pink. Taking two of the wine goblets
from his ice tray, I pass one to Karnus. “I thought that before you come to
kill me, we might as well share a drink.”
      “There’s a sport.” He downs his own drink and takes the one I offer
him. He eyes me over the glass. “You’re not a poisoner, are you?”
      “I’m not so subtle.”
      “Equal company then. All these snakes about …” He grins like a
crocodile, dark Gold eyes tracing the men and women. The wine is gone in
a moment. “It’s strangely decadent tonight.”
      “I hear Quicksilver arranged the festivities,” I say.
      “Only on Luna would they let a Silver pretend he’s a Gold.” Karnus
grunts. “I hate this moon.” He takes a delicacy off a passing tray. “Food’s
too heavy. Everything else too light. Though I hear the sixth course will be
something to die for.”
      Noting his strange tone, I cross my arms and watch the party. It’s a
strange comfort being around this hateful man. Neither one of us has to
pretend to like the other. No masks here, least not as much as usual.
      He chuckles deeply. “Julian would have liked this fancy fare. He was a
simpering, vile child.”
      I turn to examine the killer. “Cassius only said pretty things about
him.”
      “Cassius.” He snorts out something like a laugh. “Cassius once
wounded a bird with a slingshot. Came to me crying, because he knew he
had to kill it to put it out of its misery, but he couldn’t. I dropped a rock on
it for him. Just like you did.” He smirks. “I should thank you for sweeping
away the genetic chaff.”
      “Julian was your brother, man.”
      “He pissed the bed as a boy. Pissed the bed. Always tried hiding the
sheets by giving them to the laundrywomen himself. Like we didn’t own
the laundrywomen. He was a boy who did not deserve his mother’s favor or
his father’s name.” He grabs another glass of wine from a passing Pink.
“They try to make it tragedy, but it isn’t. It’s natural law.”
      “Julian was more a man than you are, Karnus.”
      Karnus laughs in delight. “Oh, do explain that one.”
      “In a world of killers, it takes more to be kind than to be wicked. But
men like you and me, we’re just passing time before death reaches down for
us.”
      “Which will be soon for you.” He nods to my razor. “Pity you weren’t
raised in our house. We learn the blade before we learn to read. My father
had us make our blades, had us name them and sleep beside them. You
might have stood a chance then.”
      “Wonder what you would have been if he had taught you something
else.”
      “I am what I am,” Karnus says, taking another drink. “And they sent
me after you, me of all the sons and daughters, because I am the best at
what I am.”
      I watch him for a moment. “Why?”
      “Why what?”
      “You have everything, Karnus. Wealth. Power. Seven brothers and
sisters. How many cousins? Nieces? Nephews? A father and mother who
love you, yet … you are here, drinking alone, killing my friends. Setting the
purpose of your life to ending me. Why?”
      “Because you wronged my family. No one wrongs the Bellona and
lives.”
      “So it’s pride.”
      “It’s always pride.”
      “Pride is just a shout into the wind.”
      He shakes his head, voice deepening. “I will die. You will die. We will
all die and the universe will carry on without care. All that we have is that
shout into the wind—how we live. How we go. And how we stand before
we fall.” He leans forward. “So you see, pride is the only thing.” His eyes
leave mine and look across the room. “Pride, and women.”
      I follow his eyes and I see her then.
      She wears black amidst a sea of gold, white, and reds. Like a dark
specter, she glides in out of the lift near the edge of the fake forest. She rolls
her flashing eyes, twists her smirking mouth at the heads that turn in her
direction to stare at her funeral gown. Black. A color to show disdain for all
the merry Golds about. Black like the color of the military uniform I now
wear. I’m reminded of the warmth of her flesh, the mischief in her voice,
the smell at the nape of her neck, the kindness of her heart. I stare so hard I
almost miss her escort.
      I wish I had missed him.
      It is Cassius.
      He of the bloodydamn golden curls is with the girl who nursed me to
health in the winter, who helped me remember Eo’s dream. His hand on her
waist. His lips whispering into her ear. As surely as Cassius au Bellona put
a sword in my stomach, he now sticks a dagger in my heart.
      His hair thick and lustrous. His chin cleft, hands steady. Shoulders
powerful, made for war. Face made for the hearts of court. And he wears
the rising sun of the Morning Knight. The rumors are true. It rips through
the party. The Sovereign has made him one of the twelve. Despite the fact
that I won the Institute, he’s risen higher, tearing through the Dueling
Circuit on Luna like an ancestor possessed. I’ve watched him on the HC,
watched him stalk around the Bleeding Place as another Gold lies near
death.
      But here, now, he dazzles, charms. Face split with a white smile. He
has all I have in his Golden body and more. He is faster on his feet than I.
As tall. More handsome. Wealthier. He has a better laugh and people think
him kinder. Yet he has none of my burdens. Why too does he deserve this
girl, who makes all but Eo pale in comparison? Does she not know how
petty he is? How cruel his heart can be?
      I cannot go to her, not even when I draw close enough to hear her
laugh. If she saw me, I think I would shatter. Would there be guilt in her
eyes? Awkwardness? Am I a shadow over her happiness? Will she even
care that I see her with him? Or will she think me pathetic for approaching
her?
      It aches, not that I suspect Mustang is being petty in seeking my
enemy, but because I know she is not petty. If she is with Cassius, it is
because she cares for him. It aches deeper than I thought it would.
      “And so you see …” Karnus’s hand falls heavily on my shoulder. “…
you will not be missed.”
      Tightness spreads through my chest as my shoulders carve a path out
of the gala. I take a smaller lift down, away from these people who know
only how to hurt. Away into the woods where I find a bridge that spans a
fast-flowing stream. I lean over the polished railing, gasping for air, each
breath a statement.
      I do not need Mustang.
      I do not need any of these greedy creatures.
      I’m done with their games of power.
      Done with trying to go it on my own.
      I was not good enough to be a husband.
      Not good enough that my wife would let me be a father.
      Not good enough to be a Gold.
      Now I’m not good enough for Mustang.
      I’ve failed to do what I set out to do.
      Failed to rise.
      But I won’t fail now. Not now.
      I take the ring. Hand trembling. Nerves stampeding inside me. I want
to retch, there’s so much wrong inside of me. I take the cold ring to my lips.
Say the words and the corrupt perish. Say “Break the chains” and Victra
vanishes. Cassius evaporates. Augustus melts. Karnus dissolves. Mustang
dies. Across the Solar System, bombs ripple and Red rises to an uncertain
future. Trust in Ares. Just trust he knows what he is doing.
      Break the chains.
      I try to say the words, Eo’s last before she hanged. But they do not
come. Force it out. Dammit. Make my mouth work. But it won’t. It can’t,
because inside I know that this is wrong. It isn’t the violence. It isn’t
compassion for the people I would kill. It’s anger.
      Killing them proves nothing. It solves nothing.
      How could this be Ares’s plan?
      Eo said if I rose, others would follow. But I’ve not yet risen. I’ve not
yet done as she asked of me. I am not an example. I am an assassin. I do not
have an excuse to give up. To hand over her dream to others. Ares never
knew Eo. He never saw the spark in her. I did. Before I draw my last breath,
I must build the world she wanted to raise our child in. That was her dream.
That was why she sacrificed, so others would not have to. And I will not let
others decide my fate. Not now. I do not trust in Ares if it means I must
reject Eo.
      Not if it means I must sacrifice my trust in myself.
      I wipe the tears from face, anger replaced by purpose. There must be
another way. A better way. I have seen the cracks in their Society, and I
know what I must do. I know what the Golds most fear. And it has nothing
to do with Reds rising. It has nothing to do with bombs or plots or
revolution. What terrifies the Golds is simple, cruel, and as old as mankind
itself.
      Civil war.

The Willow

      I stalk back into the gala.
      The Golds have taken their seats and formalities have begun in earnest.
I am not subtle as I duck beneath the table and scrounge around on the
ground to find the pegasus pendant. I put it in my pocket. Straighten my
jacket. Ignore the questioning glances and move boldly away from
Augustus’s table toward the object of my interest. Pliny hisses my name. I
pass him by. He knows nothing of what I have in store. Pliny is a man to
make rules. I’m more the breaking type.
      I weave through the tables that seat the noble families, gathering eyes
as a stone rolling down the mountain gathers snow. I feel them adding to
my velocity. My gait is careless, my hands coiled with danger, like the
muscles of a pitviper. Thousands watch me. Whispers form a cloak behind
as they realize my target; he sits at his long table surrounded by his family
members—a perfect Golden man attentively listening to his Sovereign
speak. She preaches of unity. Order and tradition are paramount. No one
rises yet to challenge me. Perhaps they don’t understand. Or perhaps they
feel the force of me now and dare not rise.
      The Bellona notice the whispers now, and they turn, almost as one, a
family of fifty and more, to see me—a martial man, all in black. Young,
untested in war. Unblooded beyond the halls of the Institute and the
asteroids of the Academy. Some have reasoned me mad. Some have called
me brave. Tonight, I’m both. The weight is gone. All the pressure I let crush
me as I worried about expectations, as I gentlefooted around making a
decision. All velocity, I tell myself. Don’t freeze. Don’t stop. Never stop.
      The Sovereign’s voice falters now.
      Too late to go back. I dive in.
      Smile.
      And the gala goes dead silent as I spring thirty feet in the low gravity
and land hard on the Bellona table. Dishes crack. Servers scatter. Bellonas
fall back. Some shout at me. Some do not move even as their wine spills.
The Sovereign watches, struck by curiosity, her Furies stirring at her side.
Pliny looks about to die. He’s gripping his knees in panic. Beside him, the
Jackal is as strange and unreadable as a lonely desert creature.
      I did not wear dress shoes tonight. My boots are thick and heavy. They
crack the porcelain as I trod along the Bellona table, shattering dishes of
pudding and squishing tender steaks. My blood pumps through me.
Intoxicating. I lift my voice.
      “I’ll have your attention.” I crush a plate of peas underfoot. “You may
know me.” There’s nervous laughter. Of course they know me. They know
everyone of worth, though mine is more of rumor than substance. I see the
Furies whispering to the Sovereign. See Tactus grinning his ass off. Karnus
leans forward anxiously. Victra’s smiling at the Jackal. Even see Antonia
nudging a tall, serene Gold. I avoid looking at Mustang. Pliny gibbers in
Augustus’s ear. Augustus raises a hand to shut him up. “Do I have your
attention?” I ask.
      Yes. I do.
      “Boy, sit down!” someone shouts.
      “Make him,” Tactus replies drunkenly. “No? That’s what I surmised!”
      “For those of you who do not know, I am a lancer of the House of
Augustus, for another hour or so.” They laugh. “I am the one they call the
Reaper of Mars, who struck down a full Peerless Knight, who stormed
Olympus and made slaves of my Proctors. My name is Darrow au
Andromedus, and I have been wronged.
      “We Peerless Scarred come from Golden ancestors. From conquerors
with spines of iron. Honorable men, honorable women. But before you
today, I see a family that is dishonorable. A family with spines made of
chalk. A corrupt and fraudulent family of liars and cowards that conspires
to steal my master’s Governorship, illegally.”
      I crush a serving plate with my boots. Who knows if they conspire to
do it or not? It sounds good. It seems like they conspire. And it’s the mask I
need them to wear. Karnus replies beautifully by whipping out his razor and
surging toward me. His father, the Imperator, waves him back. Praetor
Kellan looks about to grab my feet and jerk me down where Cagney would
no doubt cut my throat with my own razor. The younger girls of their family
think me a demon. A demon that killed their cousin, brother. They have no
idea what I really am. But perhaps Lady Bellona does. Cadaverous in her
grief, she sits surrounded by her brood like a withered lioness. They look to
her as much as to her husband. The last thing I note is the trembling of her
long right hand, as though it aches for a knife with which to cut me.
      “Twice I have been wronged by this family. Once in the mud of the
Institute. Again at the Academy by that one … and this one … and that
one.” I point out all those who beat me in the gardens. I see Cassius now
near the head of the table, just by his father and mother. Mustang sits beside
him. Her face a mask. Disappointed? Upset? Bored? When she quirks an
eyebrow at me, I meet her eyes, walk toward her and set my foot on the
edge of the wine decanter that sits in front of Cassius. All eyes focus there,
like light falling into a black hole. Pausing time, space. Bending all
forward. Breaths catch. “All courts of Golden law permit a man to defend
his honor against any force that would desecrate it unjustly. From the old
lands of Earth to the icy bowels of Pluto, the right of challenge exists for
any man and any woman. My name, gentle lords and ladies, is Darrow au
Andromedus. My honor has been pissed upon. And I demand satisfaction.”
      I tip the wine over onto Cassius’s lap.
      He explodes up at me. Golds all over the grand party burst up from
their seats in a great roar. Tactus rushes from our table, joined with Leto,
Victra, all of the aides and bannermen of the vassals to my ArchGovernor—
the Corvos, the Julii, the Voloxes, the huge Telemanuses, Pax’s family.
Razors snap into hands. Curses splinter the winter air. Aja, the largest and
darkest of the Furies, leans down from the Sovereign’s table and bellows,
“Stop this madness!”
      It’s only begun.
      My hands shake like they used to in the mine. Now, as then, serpents
surround me.
      You could never hear them, the pitvipers. Could rarely see them. Black
as pupils, they slither in the shadows till they strike. But there’s a fear that
comes when they near. A fear separate from the rumbling of the drill.
Separate from the throbbing, nauseating heat that builds in your balls as you
carve through a million tons of rock and all the friction radiates up, making
a bog of piss and sweat inside your suit. It’s fearing the coming of death.
Like a shadow has passed across your soul.
      That fear fills me now as these Peerless stand around me, a mass of
serpentine gold. Whispering. Hissing. Deadly as sin.
      Snow on the ground crunches under my heavy boots. I bend down as
the Sovereign speaks. She tells of honor and tradition. How martial duels
mark the greatness of our race, so she makes an exception for the day. We
may duel beyond the gaming grounds. This bloodfeud must be put to rest
here, now, in front of the august of our race. So confident is she in her
newest Olympic Knight. But why wouldn’t she be? He’s killed me before.
     “Unlike the cowards of old, we settle flesh to flesh. Bone to bone.
Blood to blood. Vendettas die in the Bleeding Place virtute et armis,” the
Sovereign recites.
     By valor and arms. No doubt she has already spoken to her advisors.
They will say I am outmatched, that Cassius is the better swordsman. It
never would have gone this far if she hadn’t been assured a beneficial
outcome.
     “As it was with our ancestors, it is now and again to the death,” she
declares. “Are there any contentions?”
     I hoped for this.
     Neither Cassius nor I say a thing. Mustang steps forward to object, but
the Fury, Aja, shakes her head, stopping her.
     “Then today, res, non verba.” Actions, not words.
     I speak with my master before stepping into the center of the circle that
now forms as Browns cart away the tables from the snowy plain. Pliny
hovers beside Augustus. As do Leto, Tactus, Victra, and the great Praetors
of Mars. So many famous faces, so many warriors and politicians. The
Jackal stands further away, shorter than the rest, impassive, speaking to no
one. I wonder what he would say to me were there fewer ears to hear. He
does not look angry. Perhaps he’s learned to trust in my plans. He nods his
head, as if reading my thoughts. We are still allied.
     “Is this spectacle for me? For vanity? For love?” Augustus asks as I
stand before him. His eyes dig into me, trying to find meaning. I can’t help
but glance over at Mustang. Even now, she draws me from my task.
     “You’re so young,” he nearly whispers. “What they tell you in the
storybooks is wrong; love does not survive things like this. Not the love of
my daughter, at least.” He pauses, reflecting. “Her soul is like her
mother’s.”
     “I don’t do it for love, my liege.”
     “No?”
     “No.” I bow my head to him and remember Matteo’s highLingo. “The
duty of the son is the father’s glory. Is it not?” I fall to a knee.
     “You are not my son.”
      “No. The Bellona killed him, stole him from you. Your firstborn son,
Claudius, was all a man could hope for—a son better and wiser than his
father. So let me make you a present of their favorite son’s head. Enough
quibbling. Enough of their politics. Blood for blood.”
      “My liege, Julian was one thing. But Cassius …,” Pliny tries.
      Augustus ignores him.
      “I weep for your blessing,” I say again, pressing my master. “How
long will you keep the Sovereign’s favor? A month? A year? Two? Soon
she will replace you with the Bellona. Look how she favors Cassius. Look
how she steals your child. Look how the other goes the way of a Silver.
Your heirs are depleted. Your time as ArchGovernor will end. Let it. For
you are not a man fit to be ArchGovernor of Mars. You are a man fit to be
king of it.”
      His eyes flash. “We have no kings.”
      “Because none have dared craft themselves a crown,” I say. “Let this
be the first step. Spit in the Sovereign’s eye. Make me the sword of your
family.”
      I pull a knife from my boot and make a quick cut beneath my eye. The
blood falls like teardrops. This is an old blessing, from the iron ancestors,
the Conquerors. And it will chill those who see it—a relic of a bygone,
harder age. It is a Mars blessing. One of iron and blood. Of the raging ships
that burned the famed Britannic Armada above Earth’s North Pole, and
dashed the fastkillers from the land of the Rising Sun amidst the asteroid
belt. My master’s eyes ignite like dormant coals breathed upon, slowly, then
all at once.
      I have him.
      “I give my blessing freely. What you do, do in my honor.” He leans
toward me. “Rise, goldenborn. Rise, ironmade.” Augustus touches his
finger to the blood and then presses the mark beneath his own eye. “Rise,
Man of Mars, and take with you my wrath.”
      I rise to whispers. This is no simple squabble now between boys. It is
the battle of houses. Champion against champion.
      “Hic sunt leones,” he says, tilting his head—part challenge, part
benediction. What a vain swine of a man. He knows my desperation to stay
in his good graces. He knows he stands playing with matches on a powder
keg. Yet his eyes glitter lustfully, hungering for blood and the promise of
power as I hunger for air.
      “Hic sunt leones,” I echo.
      I pace back to the center of the circle, nodding to Tactus and Victra.
They touch the handles of their razors, as do the other aides. Our pack
mentality is keen. “Prime luck,” Tactus says.
      High above, ships swim quietly through the long-night. Trees sway in
the breeze. Cities sparkle in the distance. Earth hovers like a swollen moon
as I unravel my razor from my forearm.
      Mustang comes to me as Cassius’s mother kisses his forehead.
      “So you’re a pawn now?” she asks quickly.
      “And you’re a trophy?”
      She flinches before her lips curl into a slight sneer. “You say that to
me? I don’t even recognize you.”
      “Nor I you, Virginia. Serving the Sovereign now?”
      But I do recognize her, despite the terrible gulf that now makes her feel
more stranger than friend. The tightness in my chest is of her making. So
too is the awkward tension in my hands as they yearn to touch her, yearn to
hold her and tell her this is all a false guise. I’m not a pawn to her father.
I’m more than that. All this is for good. Just not their good.
      “‘Virginia.’” She cocks her head at me, smiling sadly as she spares a
glance for the two thousand waiting Peerless. “You know, I’ve wondered
over these last years … I suppose I should have wondered from the start,
but you cut such a rare character—it was distracting. But I’ll ask now.” Her
bright eyes cut through me, searching, judging. “Are you insane?”
      I look over at Cassius. “Are you?”
      “Jealousy? That’s ripe.” She leans in with a harsh whisper. “Shame
you don’t respect me enough to suppose that I have my own plan. You think
I’m here because my aching loins thrust me into Bellona arms. Please. I’m
no bitch in heat. I protect my family by any means necessary. Who do you
protect but yourself?”
      “You betray your family by being with him.” I have no false answer
that may parallel the truth. I must suffer being a villain in her eyes. Yet I
can’t meet them. “Cassius is a wicked man.”
      “Grow up, Darrow.” She looks like she’s going to say something
deeper, but she just shakes her head and, turning, says, “He’s going to kill
you. I’ll try to convince Octavia to end it early.” Her words fail her at first.
“I wish you hadn’t come to this moon.”
      She leaves me, giving Cassius a squeeze on the hand before joining the
Sovereign’s entourage on the raised dais.
      “Alone at last, my old friend,” Cassius says slashing me with a smile.
      Once we were like brothers. We shared food and raced that first day at
the Institute. Stormed House Minerva together. How he laughed when I
stole their cook and Sevro their standard. We galloped over the plains that
night underneath the light of twin moons. I remember the woe in his eyes
when they captured Quinn. When my kin, Titus, beat him and pissed on
him. How I felt the tears welling then, when we were like brothers, before it
all fell apart.
      The cinnamon-and-orange-flavored snow still falls. It settles in his
curly hair. On his broad shoulders. It was in the snow that he last fought me.
Buried rusty steel into my lower gut and left me dying in my own filth. I
have not forgotten how he twisted that blade to make sure the wound did
not close.
      His blade is ebony now.
      It curls in front of him, over a meter of narrow sword when solid.
More than two meters of lashing razor whip when loosed with the toggle on
the handle, which sends a chemical impulse through the blade’s molecular
structure. Golden marks line the blade, telling the lineage of his family.
Their conquests. The Triumphs thrown in their honor. Old, arrogant,
powerful. My blade is naked, absent of embellishment.
      “So, I’ve taken what’s yours,” he says, walking closer and nodding to
Mustang.
      I laugh, “She was never mine. And she’s certainly not yours.”
      The White arrives, hustling forward in his robes. Head bald. Back
crooked.
      “But I’ve had her in ways you haven’t.” His voice lowers so only we
might hear, “I wonder, do you lie alone at night, thinking of the pleasures I
give her? Does it vex you that I know how she kisses? How she sighs when
you touch her neck just so?”
      I don’t answer.
      “That she moans my name instead of yours?” He doesn’t laugh. He
may loathe what he says, but he’d say anything to hurt me. In most ways,
he’s not a bad man. He’s just my bad man. “In fact, she moaned as I went
inside her this morning.”
      “What would Julian say if he could see you now?” I ask.
     “He’d echo mother and beg me to kill you.”
     “Or would he weep at the devil you’ve become?”
     He uncoils his razor and ignites his aegis. My own aegis hums as I
activate it—an ion-blue transparent energy shield that bows slightly
outward from my left glove, one foot long by two feet wide. Snow melts
when I sweep the aegis near the ground. A corona of haze forms around the
blue light.
     “We’re all devils.” His sudden laugh floats up like a silk ribbon carried
away with the breeze. “This was always your problem, Darrow. You have
an inflated view of yourself. You think you have some sort of morality
tucked away. You think you are better than us, when really you are less.
Forever playing games you cannot master against people you cannot
match.”
     “I matched Julian well enough.”
     “Bastard.” His face contorts, and he lashes forward, bellowing
wordlessly, knocking me back before the White can give the benediction.
They shout for us to stop, but as the razors scream, the shouts fade away
and all eyes widen as man-killing metal wails through slow-falling snow.
He uses the tenets of kravat. Four seconds of precise, kinetic violence,
retreat. Assess. Engage.
     We are the only the only sound in this strange place. The odd, high-
pitched keen of an arching whip. The thrum of the solid blade. The crack as
aegises on left arms spark white when blades slash into them. The crunch of
snow and the creaking of leather.
     Despite his anger, Cassius is perfect in his form. His feet shuffle, never
crossing; his hips swivel as he lunges in the compact salvos. His breath
comes measured, paced. He lashes his whip forward in a sweep, then
hardens the blade and swings it up, aiming for my groin. His movements
flicker fast. Trained. Honed by masters and Swords of the Society. It’s easy
to see why he has devastated his opponents since childhood, why he gutted
me at the Institute. Because his enemies fight like him, but slower. I don’t
fight like them. I learned that lesson.
     Now he will learn his.
     “You’ve been practicing. You can match six moves a set,” he says,
drawing back. He darts forward, feinting high and sweeping low to claim
my ankles. “But you’re still a novice.” He sends a flurry of seven blows at
me, almost skewering me through the right shoulder. I recognize the
engagement pattern, but am still a fraction off his speed. I barely escape,
throwing myself out of the way of a thrust at the last moment. Two more
sets of seven come in quick succession. I barely escape the last, falling to a
knee, panting, looking around at the gathered guests.
      “Do you hear that?” he asks. I hear nothing but the wind and the
throbbing of my heart. “That is the sound of dying alone. No one to weep.
No one to care.”
      “Arcos will care,” I whisper.
      He stiffens. “What did you say?”
      “Lorn au Arcos will care if his last student dies,” I say, dropping the
falsely ragged breath, straightening proudly. Cassius stares at me as if he’s
seen a ghost. He hesitates. So too do those who hear what I say. “While you
ate, I trained. While you drank, I trained. While you sought pleasure, I
trained from the weeks after the Institute to the days before the Academy.”
      “Lorn au Arcos doesn’t accept students,” Cassius hisses. “Not for
thirty years.”
      “He made an exception.”
      “Liar.”
      “Oh?” I laugh. “Did you think I came here to be killed? Did you think
yourself entitled to my life? No, Cassius. I came here to cut you down
before your parents.”
      He steps backward, eyes dancing to his father, to Karnus. I cock my
head at him. “Come now, brother. Don’t you want to see how well I can
really fight?”
      He pauses and I charge him like some night carnivore, shoulders
hunched with primeval economy, quiet as the dark itself.
      Lorn’s words come back to me. “A fool pulls the leaves. A brute chops
the trunk. A sage digs the roots.” And so I peel apart his legs, sending set
after set into him. Not for the four seconds the Golds teach. But for seven.
Then six, alternating, then breaking the pattern. Twelve moves a set.
      His defense is precise. And if I fought as he taught me to fight, I would
die to him. But I was taught to move by my uncle, and to kill by a legend. I
rage and spin, leaving my feet and striking down, beating him as a great
hurricane slapping and smashing and hammering him back. And when he
attacks, I bow to the side until such time that I can break him, as Lorn au
Arcos trained me to do. Move in a circle. Never retreat backward. No attack
opens when a man allows himself to be pushed backward. Use their force to
create new angles. Flow around him. The Willow Way. Pretty, fluid, like a
spring song in defense, then lashing and horrible as the branches of a
willow in deep winter as glacial winds scream down from the mountains.
     Inside me, Red meets Gold.
     My blade flashes between whip and curved slingBlade. It crashes into
his sword, and the aegis on his left side crackles from the force of my
blows. Cassius falters. He’s a prizefighter getting pummeled by a back-alley
brawler.
     I’m laughing. Laughing madly and the crowd around is cheering in
shock, some screaming when I hit Cassius’s aegis so hard it overloads.
Sparks hiss from the unit on his arm. I rip open a wound there, one on his
elbow, his kneecap, his ankle. I flick the blade up and slash his face. I stop
and move backward fluidly, posing with whip as it slithers into a curved
slingBlade. Those who watch this will never forget.
     Women are screaming for Cassius. Lovers he has had in his youth,
who now watch the man they grew with, the man who bedded them, left
them with false promises, and made them think they’d just lost the strongest
of a generation. They watch as another man turns him into a throbbing mess
of blood.
     I embarrass him. But it’s all for a purpose. All to make that simmering
hatred between Bellona and Augustus boil over into war.
     I pace about the circle like a caged lion till I come in front of Imperator
Bellona.
     “Your son is going to die,” I say savagely, a foot away from his face.
     He’s thick. Square-jawed, kindly, with a pointed beard. His eyes
shimmer with the promise of tears. He says nothing. He is a noble man, and
he will follow the honorable path, even if it means watching his favorite son
die.
     Even in the midst of my rage, I feel the shame. Feel the horror of being
the man who comes from the dark to savage a family. “Will you just
watch?” I shout at the Bellona. Imperator Bellona’s wife is not so noble.
She seethes, glancing at the Sovereign accusatorily. I see what she wants.
     I go back at Cassius. They will have to watch and do nothing, as I
watched Eo.
     “Lady Bellona, are you noble enough to watch your Cassius die?
Watch as he disappears from the world?” Her lips curl. She whispers to
Karnus, to Cagney. “Is that the strength of House Bellona? Do you watch
like sheep as the wolf comes amongst the fold?”
      I make a grand show of it for the hot-blooded ones in the Bellona fold.
Cassius tries to fight. He stumbles as I cut his kneecap, falling into the snow
before scrambling desperately to his feet. His blood makes a shadow about
his feet. This is how slowly he killed Titus. He’s panicked, glancing at his
family, knowing it will be the last time he sees them. They have no Vale.
This life is their heaven. Despite everything, it is a sad sight and I pity him.
      Cagney, urged on by Lady Bellona, has already taken a step forward,
her sharp, pretty face riven with rage. I just need to hurt her strong cousin
Cassius a little more. But Imperator Bellona jerks her back with a stern
hand. He glares darkly at Augustus, then peers around the assembly.
      “No Bellona shall interfere. On my honor.”
      Yet his wife does not agree. She aims one more pointed glance at the
Sovereign, and the Sovereign raises a hand. “Hold!” she calls. “Hold,
Andromedus!”
      I’m actually stunned by the interruption.
      All look to the Sovereign’s dais. Cassius pants for breath. She can’t be
so stupid. Can she? The interruption confirms the rumors for me, for
everyone. The Sovereign reveals her favoritism. She’s chosen the Bellona
family. They will supplant the Augustuses on Mars. Cassius would have
been important to that plan. Now, because of her miscalculation, he’s about
to die and her plan is going to be squabbed. Still, I had no idea she’d do as
she’s about to do. It is so stupid. So shortsighted. Her pride has made her a
fool.
      “There has been an addendum to the rules. Since the White was unable
to give the customary benediction, the contest will be to death or yielding,”
she declares, glancing at Cassius’s mother. “Those are the limits to the duel.
So many of our prized children are lost at our schools. No need to waste
these two prime men on account of schoolyard pranks.”
      “My Sovereign,” Augustus calls, greedy for his bloody prize, “the law
is clear. Once a contest is declared, the rules may not be altered by man or
woman.”
      “You cite laws. That’s a pleasant irony, coming from you, Nero.”
      There are snickers from the crowd, which tell me rumors of his
involvement with rigging the Institute for the Jackal are very much in
fashion.
      “My Sovereign, we stand with Augustus in this matter,” booms a
voice. Daxo au Telemanus steps forward. Pax’s elder brother, tall as my
friend was, but less beastly. More a pine tree than a great boulder of a man.
Like his father, Kavax, his head his bald, but engraved with Golden angels.
A mischievous sparkle dances in sleepy eyes nestled under great swirling
eyebrows.
      “Hardly a surprise,” snarls Cassius’s mother.
      “Perfidy!” Kavax, Daxo’s father, roars. He alternates stroking his
forked red beard and the large pet fox he cradles in his left arm. “This reeks
of perfidy and favoritism. My temper is slow. But I find myself offended.
Offended!”
      “Careful, Kavax,” Octavia says icily, “some things cannot be unsaid.”
      “Why else would he say them?” Daxo asks, glancing at the families
from the Gas Giants, where he knows he will find allies in this debate. “But
I believe he would counsel you now, my Sovereign: even your words
cannot change law. Your father discovered this by your own hand, no?”
      The Sovereign’s Furies step forward menacingly. For her part, the
Sovereign allows herself only the strictest of smiles. “But, young
Telemanus, you fail to remember, my word is law.”
      This is something you do not do. A Gold may rule other Golds. But
declare your rule at your own peril. The Sovereign has been so long on the
Morning Throne that she has forgotten this. Her words are not law. They
now become a challenge.
      One I accept with open arms.
      She knows the words a mistake when she meets my eyes and we both
realize in that moment there is one move I can make that she cannot
counter.
      “You will not steal what is mine,” I growl.
      I wheel on Cassius. He brings up his blade. He never let me yield in
the mud of the Institute. He knows I will not let him yield now. His face
goes pale as I charge. He’s thinking about all he’s about to lose. How very
precious his life is. A Gold to the end. Others shout at me to stop,
screaming that it is unfair.
      This is the definition of fairness.
      They would have let me die.
      He lunges for my throat. It’s a feint. He whips his razor down to wrap
around my leg. He expects me to recoil. I charge straight at him, inside the
arch of his swing, jump over his head in the low gravity, then swing my
whip backward without looking. My whip coils around his extended right
arm. I press the button that makes the razor contract, and with the sound of
a frozen tree branch cracking in winter, I claim the sword arm of Cassius au
Bellona.
      It’s equal parts silence and screams. I do not turn, not for a long
moment. When I do, I find Cassius still standing, teetering, not long for this
world. No one else moves as Cassius falls. His father looks at the ground,
silent.
      “I said stop!” the Sovereign shouts. Two Furies jump from the dais,
landing with their blades dancing into hand.
      “Finish it,” Augustus shouts.
      I stalk toward Cassius. He spits at me, lips trembling. Contemptuous
even now. I raise my blade. Then a hand settles around my wrist. Not an
iron grip. A soft one. Warm against my skin. Delicate.
      “You’ve won, Darrow,” Mustang says quietly, coming around in front
of me so her eyes meet mine. The Furies pause outside the circle. “Don’t
lose yourself to this.”
      I could not imagine Eo watching me from the Vale. In this hell, I’ve
lost my faith. Mustang brings it sweeping back. Eo may watch me, or she
may not. Only one thing is certain. Mustang watches me now, and what I
see in her eyes is enough to let my hand fall to my side. It’s then she smiles,
as if seeing me again for the first time in years.
      “There you are.”
      “Kill him!” screams Cassius’s mother. “Kill him now!”
      “No!” roars Imperator Bellona. Too late.
      Mustang’s eyes widen.
      I turn in time to see the circle dissolve, crumbling inward as though it
were made of sand. Not altogether, but tentatively. One Bellona sprints at
me in silence, low, deadly. Another follows. Then Tactus comes from the
Augustus group. Then another lancer. I hear my friend’s war howl. A
second echoes. There’s more than just one Gold present who was in my
army.
      Cagney au Bellona is first to me. My stolen blade rasps toward my
neck. I duck, but I would have lost my head had Mustang not thrown up her
own blade to deflect the slash. Sparks sting my face, and Tactus takes
Cagney from the side, cutting her clean in half.
      Screams.
      The Bleeding Place collapses entirely. Golds of Bellona and Augustus
sprint to protect their fellows. Others flee. Karnus slashes at Tactus—too
much for my friend. I rush to his aid, saving him till Victra and others come
between Karnus and us. Mustang is lost in the fray. I search frantically for
her. A blade flashes at my head.
      Shouts boom as the Sovereign calls for peace. But it is beyond her. A
woman screams at Cagney’s ruined body. Dozens of men and women, all
with blades, slash into each other. Tactus takes a razor through the shoulder
defending me again. I spin to my friend’s aid and hack the arm off the
Bellona man as he pulls his blade out of Tactus. I jerk my friend toward me.
Slashing a path clear. A blade scratches my forearm. I glimpse Mustang in
the chaos, covering Cassius’s wounded body. I don’t know if the Bellona
will kill her. They let her sit at the table. Still, I don’t know. I rush toward
her, throwing my weight into the bodies between us. Tactus helps.
      I smash into a woman. Antonia. Her eyes light up as she brings a knife
up to my stomach, but Victra, her sister, punches her in the face and Tactus
starts kicking her in the head as she falls. Victra offers me a laughing smile
until Karnus jerks her down by her hair. He’s fought off as Leto enters the
fray, turning back the tide with the precise thrusts of his rainbow razor. The
Telemanuses join him, father and son decimating the Golds who come
before them with razors half the size of my body.
      “Tactus, on me!” I shout.
      Tactus is bleeding, but he’s up and howling madly like he’s still
fighting beside Sevro. Together, we jump high in this easy gravity. He
knows I go for Mustang. But the Bellona are too thick. Razors too deadly.
      “Mustang!” I shout, fending two Bellonas off. Slash away one’s face
and punch another in the throat with my aegis. Another joins them. And
another, till there’s a thick Bellona bullwark blocking my path.
      “Protect the ArchGovernor!” Mustang shouts at me, voice more
composed than my own, making me feel an idiot obsessed with chivalry. Of
course she does not need me to save her. “Protect my father!” And though I
can’t see her amongst the throng, I obey.
      I let Tactus jerk me away by the collar toward our retreating line,
which is being assailed from the side. Someone else roars for us to protect
Augustus. Others scream to defend Imperator Bellona and Cassius. Many
family lords have been carried away by armed cadres of family members,
who back out of the chaos with their blades at the ready. They flee the spire,
using the lifts to take them from the place, as gravBoots were forbidden. It’s
nearly deserted. The Sovereign’s Praetorians—purple-and-black-clad
Obsidians and Golds—cluster around and fly her from the ruined gala.
Razors and pulseBlades fill calloused hands. Grays come led by Golds in
Praetorian purple to disperse us. They wear riot gear and their scorchers
shoot painballs and scatterwaves at the battling families, scattering the
Golds like summer flies.
      “AUGUSTUS!” huge Karnus screams as he rushes from the Bellona
ranks, through the scatterwaves like a madman. He knocks someone down
with his shoulder, shatters a lancer’s face with his aegis, and charges
headlong at Augustus, hoping to kill his family’s rival in one fell swoop.
“AUGUSTUS!”
      Leto, our best swordsman and Augustus’s ward, intercepts him in front
of the ArchGovernor.
      “Hic sunt leones!” he calls to the sky.
      Leto moves like the sea, fluid and terrible in his grace. He crashes
Karnus back and is about to open him along the belly when suddenly he
falters. Freezes mid-swing. Karnus stumbles back, then straightens, perhaps
confused that he is still alive. He cocks his head at Leto, who reaches for his
thigh, as though stung.
      Leto sinks slowly to a knee, arms sluggish. His long hair tumbles over
his face, then he seems to freeze in place, suddenly motionless in the center
of the chaos. Sad eyes glow with the engine plume of a passing ship as it
coasts peacefully into the horizon. He is beautiful in that moment before
Karnus chops off his head.
      “Leto!” Augustus roars.
      His eyes widen and he pushes against the Telemanus men, who bear
him away. I glimpse the Jackal tucking his silver stylus into his sleeve, the
one he spun on his fingers as he proposed our secret alliance.
      We lock eyes.
      He grins toothily.
      And I know I’ve made a deal with the devil.
13
Mad Dogs

      We flee the top of the spire. I had to leave Mustang behind. She knows
what she is doing. Somehow I had managed to forget that. She always
knows what she’s bloody doing.
      “They won’t hurt her,” Augustus says to me, and I believe it’s the first
time I’ve seen emotion on his face. No. The second time. When he
screamed for Leto, it was as if he’d lost a son. He looks that way now, face
slack and older by twenty years. He lost his eldest son. He lost his second
wife, the mother of his children. Now he loses the man he adopted to
replace that son, and he fears for the woman who reminds him of that wife.
      If they do hurt her, it’s on me.
      I’ve set things in motion. For once, it couldn’t have gone better. Blood
trickles down my hands, sheeting between the fingers, pooling around the
cuticles in a horseshoe. Knuckles flex white where there is no blood. It
disgusts me, but this is what my hands were made for.
      We flee the place of winter and trees, having drenched it red. Many
carry our wounded, nearly a dozen in number. Seven dead. Barely twenty
unscathed in the entire entourage. Others are missing. Matchless Leto is
gone, Pliny’s aide was cut apart, and one of our Praetors took a blade in her
neck from Kellan au Bellona.
      I carry the Praetor in my arms and try to staunch the bleeding as we
take the lift down the spire. Hard chance. Victra presses a piece of her dress
against the wound.
      I’d give anything for a pair of gravBoots. We cluster tight around our
lord. Razors out. Blood soaks my arm to the elbow. Sweat dribbles down
my face and ribs. Red drops splatter at our cadre’s feet against the lift’s
floor, dripping from hands, wounds, blades. Yet there are white smiles
slashing the faces around me.
      I’m hot in my uniform, so I undo the top buttons. Tactus bleeds beside
me. His wound goes through his left shoulder. Clean thrust.
      “It’s just blood,” he tells Victra, who worries over him.
      “It’s a hole in you.”
      “Not a strange thing.” He smiles at her waistline. “Goryhell. You’ve
hole in you, and you don’t see me complaining. Sheeeeeeowww.” He yelps
as she jams a bandage from her dress onto his wound. He laughs in pain a
second more, then looks at me and shakes his head, eyes wild and happy.
“Training with Lorn au Arcos, man. You sneaky ponce.”
      He saved me from Cagney. I nod and bump bloody fists, past slights
and wagers on my life temporarily forgotten.
      Many of the other Golds, the Praetors, the knights, the martial men and
women in particular—and we have more in proportion to our Politicos and
economists than most houses—wipe their brows, leaving ruddy smears.
These are the sort of Golds who would tell you the problem with being a
Gold is that everyone is already conquered. Means no one worth fighting.
No one to use all that training and all that power against. Well, I just gave
them a fresh taste of battle. And even though their Governor’s ward is dead,
even though their chief Praetor bleeds out on my shoulder and Mustang is
in enemy hands, they want to play. And making corpses is the game of the
day.
      Old and young look at me hungrily. Waiting to be fed.
      This is what it’s like being the alpha, the Primus. The others look to
you for guidance. They can smell the tangy odor of blood on you before it’s
even there. Age doesn’t matter. Experience doesn’t matter. All that matters
is that I provide these sick sons of bitches with fresh kills.
      Children cry around us, startling me. Such fragile things in a night like
this. The sons and daughters of Augustus’s youngest sister. Their father
strokes their hair to calm them. Snorting, his wife bends and slaps each
child across the face till they cease their whining. “Be brave.”
      Our Obsidians and Grays are not waiting for us on the ground.
They’ve been taken somewhere. Neither are the Sovereign’s Obsidians or
her Golds coming through the air. Which means she hasn’t yet decided what
to do. Just as I thought. She can’t slaughter us. For a house to wipe out
another house is one thing, but for the great leader to do it with the power
and funds entrusted to her by the Senate? It’s happened before, and that
Sovereign was beheaded by his daughter. The daughter who now sits on the
throne.
      Oh, she must hate me for this.
      Below the lift, lights glow along the cobbled paths that cut through the
huge forest of flower trees. The musicians no longer play. Instead, we hear
shouts and screams and long periods of terrifying silence. Golds run
beneath. Fleeing to the stone halls past the forest, where they can access
their ships, fly home. Only, some aren’t fleeing. They are hunting.
      Something has happened I did not expect. Other family feuds find
satisfaction tonight. It felt the same at the Institute when the other students
realized it wasn’t a game. That there weren’t rules. An eerie feeling, a
notion that devils roam the grounds instead of men. Who knows what
anyone will do now that the rules are gone?
      There are four hunters in the distance. A pack of three men and one
young woman dash silently through the forest. They hop a brook. Running
with all the vigor of the hungry. All the ambition of youth. From House
Falthe, it seems. I recognize raisin-eyed Lilath, the girl the Jackal sent to
deliver the holo of me killing Julian to Cassius. With her is Cipio, the stout
young man who once aided Antonia in and out of the bedroom.
      We watch them in silence as our lift descends. Carrying death, the lean
pack streaks through the trees toward an unsuspecting line of House Thorne
family members, all in dresses and suits of red and white; too late they head
frantically for the stone halls. Their standard is the rose. It falls as the killers
burst from the trees. A family dies. Scary how quiet and fast it is with
razors. Different from my duel. I took my time. They don’t. I see a boy of
ten cut apart. There’s no mercy for Gold children. They are not seen as
innocent. They’re enemy seeds. Destroy them or fight them years from
now. A woman in a ball gown slashes back, manages to kill one of the
Falthes before being cut down. Two children run. One is caught. The other
escapes. She’s the only one.
      Then the Falthe lancers dance. Taking large, exaggerated stomps. They
turn in different directions, grinding their toes into the dark ground. They
aren’t dancing.
      “Goryhell,” Tactus curses, and rubs his face.
      “The children …,” Victra whispers.
      Augustus says nothing, his face as resolute as stone.
      “The Thornes have fifteen children.” Tears bead in Victra’s eyes,
surprising me.
      “Monsters,” the Jackal whispers, sending chills up my spine, because
his acting is so damn good. He couldn’t give a piss.
      Children. Would Eo have sung if she’d known this was the chorus? We
all carry burdens. And as the killers slip away from the murdered family, I
know my burden will crush me under its weight one day. Just not today.
       “Data jammer deployed,” says Daxo au Telemanus. He flashes me the
datapad on his wrist. “Datapads are dead. They don’t want us contacting our
ships in orbit.”
       Augustus looks at his blank datapad and says that soon the other
families will be summoning their Obsidian, Gold, and Gray attendants. We
must be off planet and back in a position of strength before the tide turns
against us.
       “You made this chaos, Darrow. Deliver me from it.” He leans toward
me and feels the pulse of the Praetor I carry. “Get rid of her. She’ll be dead
in a minute.” He wipes his hands. “The children weigh us down enough
already.”
       The Praetor murmurs something to me as I set her on the floor of the
lift. I don’t know what she says. When I die, I will say nothing because I
know the Vale waits on the other side. What waits for this warrior? Only
darkness. I didn’t even understand her last words, and we discard her like a
broken sword. I close her eyes with my bloody fingers, leaving long, fading
marks. Victra squeezes my shoulder.
       Standing, I give my orders to the lancers and the other men of war.
There are fifteen I would consider good killers. Some my age, others well
into old age. Yet not one contradicts me. Not even Pliny. The Telemanuses
in particular seem eager to follow. Each holds my gaze longer than
necessary, nodding deeper than mere formality.
       “I hope no one is bored.” They laugh. “We’ll have company if another
family decides they may earn favor with the Bellona or the Sovereign by
taking the ArchGovernor’s head,” I say. “We must kill that company, and
carve our way to the hangars. Telemanus, you and your son are now the
ArchGovernor’s shadows. Attend nothing else. Do you understand?” They
nod their massive heads. “Hic sunt leones.”
       “Hic sunt leones.”
       When the lift reaches ground, forty men and women wait for us.
Family Norvo of Triton and Family Codovan of Jupiter’s moons.
       “Unfortunate odds,” Tactus sighs.
       “Cordovan and Norvo are ours,” Augustus replies. “Bought and paid
for.”
       “Rapscallion! Codovan, you rapscallion!” Kavax thunders. “I thought
you were a Bellona man!”
      Augustus expected something like this.
      I take command of the new Golds. Again, I thought someone would
object. They just stand watching me, waiting for my orders. All these
Praetors, all these politicians and sinewy men and women of war. I hold
back a chuckle. Amazing the power you have when you’re bloody up to the
sleeves and none of it is your own.
      We escort the ArchGovernor out of the forest. Three times we’re
assailed, but I have Tactus take Augustus’s cloak and lead some of the
attackers on a wild-goose chase. Roses of a thousand shades fall from the
trees as Golds fight beneath them. They’re all red in the end.
      The gang of three from House Falthe try to ambush Tactus as he
returns to the main body. He wheels on them and with little help lays all but
Lilath low. She scampers off as he kills Cipio and stomps on the dead man.
“Babykillers,” he spits over and over, till Victra pulls him away. I watch for
the Jackal. Every moment I expect a dart in the back, to die as Leto did. But
the Jackal merely follows, as does his father. No one saw what he did to
Leto. Or if they did, their fear silences them.
      When we reach the stone halls beyond the forest, finally crossing a
white limestone bridge, the rules of the Society seem to return. LowColors
skitter out of our way as we, now seventy strong, storm through the halls to
the hangars to leave this moon. But when we reach our hangar, we find that
our ship is gone. We rush to the landing pads lined with trees and grass. All
the family ships are missing. Society ripWings patrol the sky.
      We question a shaking Orange. Tactus holds him up by his collar. He
shudders as he looks at us seventy bloody souls. He’s never spoken to a
Gold before, much less ones like us. Victra knocks Tactus’s hand away and
speaks quietly to the Orange.
      “He says the ships were required to return home two hours ago.”
      “First they don’t let Obsidians into the gala, now this,” Tactus mutters.
      “That means the Sovereign planned something,” says the Jackal. “A
something that was never allowed to blossom. She removed our Obsidians,
our ships, to isolate the houses from their sources of power,” he explains,
eyeing the Telemanuses warily. “Marooning us. What do you suppose she
had up her little sleeves, Father?”
      Augustus ignores his son; he’s looking to the sky.
      “Mothermercy,” Victra curses.
      “Gather yourselves!” Kavax bellows to his warriors.
      “Piss on my face.” Tactus goes pale beside me.
      I look up and see doom coming. “Praetorians!” Seventy razors curl
out and we fan apart in case they have energy weapons.
      “Darrow. You’re with me,” Augustus says.
      The enemy is little more than black dots in the night sky. But our eyes
are keen. The dark bastards streak from the darkness and impact the ground
like fallen devils, always in their threes.
      Thumpthumpthump. Thumpthumpthump. Thumpthumpthump.
      They land between the trees on the grass, blocking our way back to the
Citadel. Obsidian Praetorians and Gold knight-captains. The Praetorian
Obsidians are titanic, like golems pulled from the stone of some mountain.
Crueler by far than those we used at the Academy. No armor like theirs in
all the worlds. Dark purple inlaid with black, like coral curling over their
titan bodies. They stand in tight squad formation, loyal and bound to each
other as they are to their faith.
      Thumpthumpthump till there are ninety-nine. Thump. Their Golden
commander lands last, on a knee. He rises, tall helmet a laughing wolfskull.
His cape of gold, emblazoned with the pyramid of the Society, kicks
sideways in the wind. An Olympic Knight. There are twelve in the Solar
System, sworn to protect the Compact of the Society against all who’d defy
it. This is the Rage Knight, the post Lorn filled for sixty years till he left for
Europa. They represent what the Golds see as the dominant themes of man,
the same as our school houses. A man slighter than myself wears the armor.
So the Sovereign’s already filled Lorn’s former post.
      “Declare yourself, knight!” I shout.
      The knight allows his helm to melt back into his armor. His flaxen hair
falls over an ugly hatchet face. Wet from sweat, lined with age and stress. I
bark out a laugh when he smiles out that sideslash of a mouth. I draw stares.
Now they’ll only think me madder. The Rage Knight falls from the sky, and
I laugh in his face.
      He cackles. “Don’t you recognize me, you little shiteater?”
      “Fitchner, you look uglier than I remember!”
      “Fitchner?” Tactus snorts. “How nostalgic.”
      “Hello, boyo.” Fitcher laughs at seeing Tactus in the ArchGovernor’s
cloak. “Nice cape, but you’re not ArchGovernor Augustus.” Fitchner clucks
his tongue and sets his hands on his hips. “ArchGovernor! ArchGovernor!
Darling, where the devil are you?”
      The ArchGovernor rolls his eyes and steps past me. “Proctor Mars.”
      “There’s the darling! And that’s an old title, didn’t you know?”
      “I see you have a new helmet.”
      “It is pretty, isn’t it? The ladies love it. Can’t remember when I was
laid so much by Golden stock.” Fitchner moves his hips suggestively. “It
was such a bother getting it. Thought there’d never be an end to the duels
and tests! We did it in front of the Sovereign, boyo. Each man, each woman,
making their case. Everyone who thought the post should be theirs. Time
and again. But fortune favors the nasty!”
      “How …,” I wonder aloud. “You beat everyone?”
      “Hardly,” my ArchGovernor sneers. “It goes to the great warriors.” He
strafes Fitchner with his eyes. “Which you are not, Fitchner. What did you
promise the Sovereign for your new helmet?”
      “Oh, I rode Darrow’s star when he beat your boy. Hello, Jackal, you
little rugrat. Then there was a gorydamn contest and, well, you can ask
Tactus’s oldest brother and Proctor Jupiter about the specifics.…” He
strikes a pose. “I’m more than meets the eye, eh?”
      “So you don’t have a new master with the new helmet?” Augustus
asks.
      “Master? Pfah!” Fitchner comically puffs up his chest. “Olympic
Knights have no master but our conscience. We defend the Society’s
Compact, subservient only to our duty.”
      “Once. Now you are the Sovereign’s servants,” Daxo declares.
      “As are we all, my dear Telemanus,” Fitchner replies. “Great admirer
of your brother and your family, by the bye. Wonderful warhammer you
carried at that tournament on Thebos. Gorydamn scary lineage. I’ve always
meant to ask, which of your ancestors screwed the rhinoceros?”
      Daxo raises his eyebrows in delicate offense. Kavax grumbles like his
son Pax might have.
      “Sorry. Was it a grizzly instead?” Fitchner grunts another laugh. “A
joke. Keen? We’re all servants, though, eh? Gorydamn slaves to the one
with the scepter.”
      “I assume, then, your loyalty to Mars is gone and cannot be …
remembered?” Augustus asks. “Since you’re a servant.”
      Fitchner claps his gloved hands together. “Mars? Mars? What is Mars
but a gorydamn hunk of rock? It’s done nothing for me.”
     “Mars is home, Fitchner.” Augustus waves to those around us. “The
Sovereign bid you to find us. Well, here we are—kin from your own planet.
Will you join your loyalty to us? Or will you give us up?”
     “Oh, you are a jokester, Augustus! A prime jokester. My loyalties are
to the Compact and to myself, as yours are to yourself, my liege. Not to a
rock. Not to false kin. And it benefits me to be loyal to the Sovereign. Now,
I’ve been told to place you and your kin under house arrest. You recall we
set aside a prime villa for your pleasure? It’d be dandyfine if you could
scamper on back there. Enjoy our hospitality, eh, boyo?”
     “You forget yourself,” Augustus hisses.
     “I forget much. Where I put my pants. Who I’ve kissed. Who I’ve
killed.” Fitchner touches his arms, his belly, his face. “But forget myself?
Never!” He points to the Obsidians around him. “And I’ve certainly not
forgotten my dogs.”
     “And where are mine? Where is Alfrún?”
     “I killed your Stained mutts. Both of them.” Fitchner smiles. “They
were barking, Augustus. Barking so loudly.”
     Rage burns across Augustus’s face.
     “I hope they weren’t expensive, boyo,” Fitchner says with a smile.
     “You speak as though we are familiars, Bronzie.”
     “We are familiar.”
     “As though we were equal. We are not equal. I am a descendant of the
Conquerors, of the Iron Golds. I am the lord of a planet. What are you? A
—”
     “I’m a man with a stunFist.” He shoots Augustus in the chest.
Augustus crumples backward as his Praetors gasp. “That’ll show him to not
wear his armor to galas. Now!” Fitchner smiles. “Who can I reason with?”
     “Me.” The Jackal takes a step forward. “I am heir to this house.”
     “Hmm … pass! You’re creepy.”
     He shoots the Jackal in the chest with the stunFist.
     “Foolishness! Enough foolishness.” Kavax steps forward, pushing his
son back. “Speak with me or Darrow. It’s plain enough, your intentions.”
     “Indeed. Darrow. You shall come with me.”
     “Like hell,” Victra sneers, stepping in front of me.
     Fitchner rolls his eyes. “Telemanus, you and your son take the
ArchGovernor back to his villa and then return to your own. Matters must
be sorted.” Fitchner gazes quietly at the bald Gold. His words now scrape
out like raw iron on slate. “This is not a request, Telemanus.”
      Telemanus looks to me. “My boy trusted this one. So shall I.”
      “I need your assurance my friends will not be hurt,” I say to Fitchner.
      He looks at Victra. “They won’t be.”
      “Convince me.”
      He sighs, bored.
      “The Sovereign can’t gorywell execute an entire house absent a trial
for treason. Can she? That violates the Compact. And you know how that
would make us Olympic Knights feel, not to mention the other houses.
Remember how her father met his end. But if you resist, well, that’s another
matter entirely.” Fitchner flips a piece of gum into his mouth. “Do you
resist?”
      I cast a look at my company, favoring Kavax au Telemanus and his son
with smile of gratitude. What trust they give the man who led their son to
his death.
      I clench my teeth and bow. “Then I suppose I am at the Sovereign’s
service.”
      “As are we all.”
14
The Sovereign

      “Once upon a time, there was a family of strong wills,” she says, voice
slow and measured as a pendulum. “They did not love one another. But
together they presided over a farm. And on that farm, there were hounds,
and bitches, and dairy cows, and hens, and cocks, and sheep, and mules,
and horses. The family kept the beasts in line. And the beasts kept them
rich, fat, and happy. Now, the beasts obeyed because they knew the family
was strong, and to disobey was to suffer their united wrath. But one day,
when one of the brothers struck his brother over the eye, a cock said to a
hen, ‘Darling, matronly hen, what would really happen if you stopped
laying eggs for them?’”
      Her eyes burn into mine. Neither of us look away. Silence in the sparse
suite, except the sound of rain at the windows of her skyscraper. We’re
amongst the clouds. Ships pass in the haze outside like silent, glowing
sharks. The leather creaks as she leans forward and steeples her long
fingers, which are painted red, a lone splash of color. Then her lips curl in
condescension, accenting each syllable as though I were an Agea street
child only just learning her language.
      “You remind me of my father.”
      The one she beheaded.
      That’s when she fixes me with the most enigmatic smile I may ever
have seen. Mischief dances in her eyes, subdued and quiet beneath the cold
trappings of power. Somewhere inside is the nine-year-old girl who
infamously started a riot by throwing diamonds from an aircar.
      I stand before her. She sits on a couch by a fire. Everything is Spartan.
Hard. Cold. A Gold woman of iron and stone. All this drabness as if to say
she needs not luxury or wealth, just power.
      Her face is creased but not faded by time. A hundred years, or so I
hear, not cracked by the pressures of office. If anything, pressure has made
her like those diamonds she scattered. Unbreakable. Ageless. And she will
be without age for some time longer, if the Carvers continue their cellular
rejuvenation therapy.
      That is the problem. She will cling to power far too long. A king reigns
and then he dies. That is the way of it. That is how the young justify
obeying their elders—knowing it will one day be their turn. But when their
elders do not leave? When she rules for forty years, and may rule for a
hundred more? What then?
      She is the answer to that question. This is not a woman who inherited
the Morning Throne. This is a woman who took it from a ruler who had not
the courtesy to die in a timely fashion. For forty years others have tried to
take it from her. Yet here she sits. Timeless as those fabled diamonds.
      “Why did you disobey me?” she asks.
      “Because I could.”
      “Explain.”
      “Nepotism shrivels under the light of the sun. When you changed your
mind to protect Cassius, the crowd rejected your moral and legal authority.
Not to mention, you contradicted yourself. That in itself is weakness. So I
exploited it, knowing I could get what I wanted without consequence.”
      Dangerous Aja, the Sovereign’s favorite killer, sits in a chair near the
window—a powerful panther of a woman with skin duskier than her
siblings’, and eyes with slitted pupils. She is one of the Olympic Knights,
the Protean Knight to be technic. She was Lorn’s last student before me.
Though he didn’t teach her everything. Her armor is gold and midnight blue
and writhes with sea serpents.
      A young boy enters quietly from another room to sit beside Aja. I
recognize him immediately. The Sovereign’s only grandson, Lysander. No
older than eight, but so very composed. Regal in his quiet, thin as a scarf.
But his eyes. His eyes are beyond gold. Almost a yellow crystal, so bright
they could nearly be said to shine. Aja watches me appraise the boy. She
takes him onto her lap protectively and bares her teeth, their whiteness
fiercely bright against her dark skin. Like a great cat playfully saying hello.
And for the first time I can remember, I glance away from a threat. The
shame burns hot and sudden in me. I might as well have kneeled to her.
      “But there are always consequences,” the Sovereign says. “I’m
curious. What did you want out of that duel?”
      “The same as Cassius au Bellona. The heart of my enemy.”
      “Do you hate him so much?”
      “No. But my survival instinct is … enthusiastic. Cassius, as far as I am
concerned, is a stupid boy crippled by his upbringing. His stock is limited.
He talks of honor but he stoops to ignoble things.”
      “So it wasn’t for Virginia?” she asks. “It wasn’t to claim her hand or
sate your jealous rage?”
      “I’m angry, but I’m not petty,” I snap. “Besides, Virginia isn’t the sort
of woman who would stand for such things. If I did it for her, I would have
lost her.”
      “You have lost her,” Aja growls from the side.
      “Yes. I realize she has a new home, Aja. Easy to see.”
      “Do you lash out at me, my goodman?” Aja touches her razor.
      “My goodlady, I do but lash out.” I smile slowly at her.
      “She’ll gut you like a pig, boyo,” Fitchner says quickly. “Don’t give a
piss if Lorn taught you how to wipe your ass. Think twice on who you
insult here. The true blades of the Society do not duel for sport. So mind
your gorydamn tongue.”
      I touch my razor.
      He snorts. “If you were a threat, do you think they’d let you keep
that?”
      I nod to Aja. “Another time, perhaps.” I turn back to the Sovereign,
straightening. “Perhaps we should discuss why you are holding my house
under military guard. Are we under arrest? Am I?”
      “Do you see shackles?”
      I look at Aja. “Yes.”
      The Sovereign laughs. “You’re here because I want you to be.”
      An idea comes to me. I try not to smile. “My liege, I should like to
apologize,” I say loudly. They wait for me to continue. “My manners have
always been … lacking. And so I find the manner of my actions nearly
always distracts from their purpose. The base fact is, Cassius deserved
worse than what I supplied. That I disobeyed you was not meant as insult
by myself or the ArchGovernor. Were he not unconscious on account of
your dog”—I glance at Fitchner—“I wager he would do what needed to be
done to make amends.”
      “Make amends,” she repeats. “For …”
      “For the disturbance.”
      She looks to Aja. “Disturbance, he says. Dropping a dish is a
disturbance, Andromedus. Helping yourself to another man’s wife is a
disturbance. Killing my guests and cutting off the arm of an Olympic
Knight is not a disturbance. Do you know what it is?”
      “Fun, my liege?”
      She leans forward. “It is treason.”
      “And you know how we treat with treason,” Aja says. “My father
taught my sisters and me.” Her father, the Ash Lord. Burner of Rhea. Lorn
did not like him.
      “An apology from you is insufficient,” the Sovereign says.
      “Wrong,” I reply.
      The Sovereign is caught off guard by my tone.
      “I said I should like to apologize. But the problem is, I cannot, because
it should be you who apologizes to me.”
      Silence.
      “You little whelp,” Aja says, rising slowly.
      The Sovereign stops her, words cutting clear and cold. “I did not
apologize to my father when I took his head from his body. I did not
apologize to my grandson when his mother’s ship was destroyed by
Outriders. I did not apologize when I burned a moon. So why would I
apologize to you?”
      “Because you broke the law,” I say.
      “Perhaps you were not listening. I am the law.”
      “No. You’re not.”
      “So you are a student of Lorn’s after all. Did he tell you why he
abandoned his post? His duty?” She looks at Lysander. “Why he abandoned
his grandson?”
      I did not know the boy was Lorn’s grandson. My teacher’s retirement
makes sudden sense. He always spoke of Society’s fading glory. How men
have forgotten themselves mortal.
      “Because he saw what you have become. You are no Empress. This is
no empire. We are the Society. We are bound by laws, by hierarchy. No
person stands above the pyramid.” I look to her killers. “Fitchner, Aja, you
protect the Society. You ensure peace. You sail to the far reaches of the
System to root out weeds of chaos. But above all else, what is the purpose
of the twelve Olympic Knights?”
      “Go on,” Aja says to Fitchner. “Play into his mummer’s farce. I will
not.”
      Fitchner drawls out, “To preserve the Compact.”
      “To preserve the Compact,” I say. “And the Compact states, ‘A duel,
once begun, cannot reach resolution until its terms are properly fulfilled.’
The terms were death. But Cassius is not dead. His arm will not suffice. I
honor the iron ancestors and my rights stand inviolable. So give me what is
mine. Give my the gorydamn head of Cassius au Bellona. Or reject the
legacy of our people.”
      “No.”
      “Then we have nothing more to discuss. You may find me on Mars.”
      I turn on my heel and walk toward the door.
      “Work for me,” the Sovereign calls.
      I stop in my tracks. These people are so bloodydamn predictable. They
all want what they can’t have.
      “Why?” I ask without turning.
      “Because I can give you resources Augustus cannot. Because Virginia
has already seen how true that is. You want to be with her, don’t you?”
      “Why would you want a man who so easily trades his allegiance?” I
turn and look Fitchner dead in the eye. “Such a man is little more than a
common whore.”
      “Augustus abandoned you before you abandoned him,” the Sovereign
says. “His daughter saw it even if you don’t. I will not abandon you. Ask
my Furies. Ask their father. Ask Virginia. I give a chance to those who
stand apart. Join at my side. Lead my legions and I will make you an
Olympic Knight.”
      “I am an Aureate.” I spit on the ground. “I am no trophy.”
      I stalk away.
      “If I can’t have you, no one can.”
      Then they come. Three Stained file through the door. Each a foot taller
than I. Each garbed in purple and black and carrying pulseAxes and
pulseBlades. Their faces hide behind bonelike masks. Eyes of killers grown
in the arctic poles of Earth and Mars stare out at me. Glittering black, like
oil. I pull my razor and take my battle stance. Their throat-sung war chant
rumbles under their masks, like the funeral dirge for a dead god.
      “Go on. Sing to your gods.” I twirl my razor. “I’ll send you to meet
them.”
      “Reaper, please stop,” Lysander calls loudly. I turn to find him walking
toward me, hands splayed plaintively. His coat is simple and black. He
stands half my height.
      His voice floats. Trembles like a delicate bird’s.
      “I have watched all your videos, Reaper. Six, maybe seven times. Even
the Academy. My tutors believe you are the closest man to the Iron Golds
since Lorn au Arcos, the Stoneside.”
      That’s when I realize why he’s looked so nervous. I almost laugh. I’m
this little bastard’s boyhood hero.
      “We need not see you die tonight. Could you not find a home here as
you found with Sevro? With Roque and Tactus, and Pax, the Howlers, and
all your great warriors? We have warriors too. You could lead them. But
…” He steps back. “If you fight, then you die because you make the
mistake of believing righteousness puts you beyond my grandmother’s
power.”
      “It does,” I say.
      “Reaper, there is no place beyond her power.”
      This is how it happens. They give them heroes. They raise them on lies
and violence, and then they let them grow into monsters. What would he be
without their guiding hand?
      “He wanted to see you,” the Sovereign says. “I told him legend never
matches fact. Better not to meet your heroes.”
      “And what do you think?” I ask little Lysander.
      “It all depends on your next choice,” he says delicately.
      “Join us, Darrow,” Fitchner drawls. “This is the place for you now.
Augustus is done.”
      Smiling inwardly, I relax my blade. Lysander clenches a fist happily. I
pace with him back to his grandmother, playing along but not yet
proclaiming any allegiance.
      “You’re always telling me to bow,” I tell Fitchner as I pass.
      He shrugs. “Because I don’t want you to break, boyo.”
      “Lysander, fetch me my box,” the Sovereign says. Happily, the boy
rushes out of the room as I sit across from his grandmother. “I fear the
Institute taught you the wrong lesson—that you can overcome anything if
you but try. That is incorrect. In the real world, you must go along. You
must cooperate and compromise. You cannot bend the worlds to your
morals.”
      “Why the hell not?”
      She sighs. “Your pride is uglier than you think.”
      Lysander returns moments later, carrying a small wooden box. He
hands it to his grandmother and waits patiently by her side, eating a tart that
Aja hands him. The Sovereign sets the box on the table.
     “You value trust. So do I. Let us play a game absent weapons, absent
armor. No Praetorians. No lies. No falsity. Just us and our naked truths.”
     “Why?”
     “If you win, you may request anything of me. If I win, I get the same.”
     “If I ask for the head of Cassius?”
     “I will saw it off myself. Now open the box.”
     I lean forward. Chair creaking. Rain patters on the windows. Lysander
smiles. Aja watches my hands. And Fitchner, like me, has no idea what’s in
the bloodydamn box.
     I open it.
15
Truth

      It takes everything I am not to flee. What comes hissing from the box
is pulled out of nightmare, pulled so perfectly out of the depths of my
subconscious that I nearly think the Sovereign knows where I come from.
Where I truly come from.
      “The game is one of questions,” she says. “Lysander, please do the
honors.” She hands her son a knife. The boy cuts the sleeve of my uniform
to the elbow, rolling it back to expose my forearm. His hands are gentle. He
smiles at me apologetically.
      “Don’t be afraid,” he says. “Nothing bad will happen, so long as you
don’t lie.”
      The carved creatures from the box—two of them—stare at me with
three blind eyes apiece. Part scorpion. Part pitviper. Part centipede. They
move like liquid glass, organs, skeleton, visible through skin, chitinous
mouths chattering and hissing at the same time as one slithers onto the
table.
      “No lies.” I force a laugh. “That’s a breezy order when you’re a child.”
      “He never lies,” Aja says proudly. “None of us do. Lies are rust on
iron. A blemish on power.”
      Power they’re so drunk on, they can’t even remember how many lies
they stand upon. Tell my people you don’t lie, you brutish bitch, and see
what they do to you.
      “I call these Oracles,” the Sovereign says. One of her rings ripples
liquid, forming a shell over her finger, turning it into a talon, needle
growing slowly at the end. With this needle, she pricks my wrist and says
the words “Truth over all.”
      One Oracle slips forward, skittering onto my arm, coiling itself around
my wrist. Its strange mouth seeks the blood, latching on like a leech. Its
scorpion tail arches four inches upward, drifting back and forth like a cattail
in summer wind. The Sovereign pricks her own wrist, repeats the oath, and
the second Oracle slithers from the box.
      “Zanzibar the Carver designed this especially for me in his Himalayan
laboratories,” she says. “The poison won’t kill you. But I’ve cells filled
with men who have played my game and lost. If there is a hell, what’s in
that stinger is as close to it as science has let us come.”
      My pulse quickens as I watch the tail sway.
      “Sixty-five,” Aja says of my pulse. “He was resting at twenty-nine
beats per minute.”
      The Sovereign lifts her head at that. “As low as twenty-nine?”
      “When are my ears wrong?”
      “Calm yourself, Andromedus,” the Sovereign says. “The Oracle is
designed to measure truth. It’s in fluctuations of temperature, chemicals in
the blood, pulse of the heart.”
      “You don’t have to play if you don’t want, Darrow,” Aja purrs. “You
can go the easy way with the Praetorians. Death is not so bad.”
      I glare at the Sovereign. “Let’s play.”
      “Would you assassinate me tonight if you could?”
      “No.”
      We all watch the Oracle. Even I. After a moment, nothing happens. I
swallow in relief. The Sovereign smiles.
      “This game doesn’t have an end,” I mutter. “How do I even win?”
      “You make me lie.”
      “How many times have you played this game?” I ask.
      “Seventy-one. In the end, I’ve trusted only one other. Where does
Augustus hide his unregistered electromagnetic weapons?”
      “Asteroid depots, hidden armories throughout Mars’ cities.” I list the
particulars. “And in the dais of his reception room.” That surprises them.
“Where are yours?”
      She lists off sixty locations in fast order. She tells everything because
she’s never lost. She’s never had to worry about the information walking
out the door. Such confidence.
      “What does that pegasus pendant mean to you?” she asks. “Is it from
your father?”
      I look down. It’s spilled out of my shirt. “It means hope. Part of my
father’s legacy. Did you help Karnus at the Academy?”
      “Yes. I gave him that ship he rammed you with. Did you really intend
to launch yourself at his bridge?”
      “Yes. Why did you bring Virginia into your inner circle?”
      “The same reason you fell in love with her.”
      My pulse quickens. Aja smiles, hearing it.
      “Virginia is special. And we both come from fathers who … left much
to be desired. When I was a girl, I would have given anything to belong to a
different family. But I was the daughter of the Sovereign. I gave her a gift
no one could have given me.
      “You see, I collect people I enjoy, Andromedus. I even enjoy Fitchner
there. Many might see him as repugnant. Might think his heritage unseemly,
but, like you, he is so very talented. When I asked him to play this game
before becoming one of my Olympic Knights, you know what he said?”
      “I can imagine.”
      “Fitchner …”
      He shrugs his slumped shoulders. “Told you to stick the box up your
cootch. I’m not an idiot.”
      “I think it was even more crass than that,” Aja grumbles.
      “My turn.” The Sovereign examines her Rage Knight. “Did Fitchner
violate his oath as a Proctor and cheat at the Mars Institute, as rumor would
have me believe?”
      “Yes,” I say, watching the Oracle instead of my old Proctor. “He
cheated like the rest.” I know Fitchner would not have gained this post were
she not sure of his loyalty to her and not Augustus, which means Fitchner
must have come clean and supplied her with details of Augustus’s ill
dealings. I glance back at the man. “Though I don’t know if he was paid
like the others.”
      “He wasn’t. Their mistake,” the Sovereign says. “Gave us video
evidence. Audio. Bank statements. Useful leverage against each Proctor.”
      Sevro must have given his father the video footage when I had him
tinkering with it. Crafty little bastard. He actually does care about his father,
after all. Augustus would kill them both if he knew about the duplicity.
      “Who would have thought,” I say. “Machiavelli himself.” He just
shrugs.
      I want to interrogate the Sovereign about military outposts. Supply
lines. Operational imperatives and security measures. But I know that
would be strange. It would lead to her asking strange questions of her own.
The Oracle tightens slightly on my arm, sucking out only tiny drops of
blood at a time. I don’t know how well this thing can sense untruths. But
what do I do if she asks me where I was born? Who my father is? Why I
rub dirt between my fingers before I fight? Shit. She could just ask me if
I’m a Red. But how would she ever think to do that unless I gave her the
sense that something was … off about me?
      “Are any in my inner circle your spies?” I ask.
      “Very clever. No. Where did you go with Victra au Julii three days
ago? And what did you do?” the Sovereign asks.
      “To Lost City.” Somehow, the Oracle senses I’m holding back. Its
stinger trembles with excitement. “To meet the Jackal—Augustus’s son.” It
tightens further. “To form an alliance.” Sweat beads on my collar and the
Oracle relaxes, the answer sufficient. “Why do they call Lorn Stoneside?”
      “He didn’t tell you? It’s not because he’s tough as stone like they’d tell
you now. It’s because on campaign in the Moon Rebellion, he was famous
for eating anything. And one day a Gray bet him he couldn’t eat stones.
Lorn doesn’t back down. When did Lorn teach you?”
      “Every morning before first light, between my graduation from the
Institute and enrollment at the Academy.”
      “Incredible no one found out.”
      “How many Peerless Scarred are there?” I ask. “Census data is so hard
to come by.” The Board of Quality Control is monstrous in hoarding its
high-level material.
      “There are 132,689, for nearly 40 million Golds. Why did Lorn take
you as a student?”
      “Because he thinks we’re the same sort of man. What are your two
greatest fears?”
      “Octavia …,” Aja warns.
      “Shut up, Aja. All’s fair.” She looks over to Lysander and smiles. “My
greatest fear is that my grandson will grow up to be like my father. The
second is the inevitability of age. Why did you cry when you killed Julian
au Bellona?”
      “Because he was kinder than the world let him be. Did you arrange
Virginia and Cassius’s courtship?”
      “No. It was her idea.”
      I’d held on to hope that it was something arranged, something she had
to do.
      “Why did you sing the Red ballad to Virginia at the Institute?”
      “Because she forgot the words, and I think it the saddest song ever
sung.” I pause before my next question.
      “You want to ask about Virginia again, don’t you?” The corners of her
lips twitch with pleasure as she plucks my pain. “Do you want to know if
I’ll give her to you if you join me? It’s possible.”
      “She is not a thing to be given,” I say.
      She laughs, amused at my innocence. “If you say so.”
      “Where are the three Deep Space Command Centers?” I ask recklessly.
      She gives me the coordinates without blinking. “How did you know
the words to the Reaping Song?”
      “I heard it as a boy. And I forget little.”
      “Where?”
      “It’s not your turn,” I remind her. “Why are you asking me these
questions?”
      “Because one of my Furies has led me to suspect the Sons of Ares are
perhaps something different than we imagined. Something more dangerous.
Who is Ares?”
      My heart thunders.
      “I don’t know.” I watch the Oracle’s tail. It doesn’t move. “Who you
do think Ares is?”
      “Your master.”
      “Thirty-nine, forty-two, fifty-six …,” Aja says.
      The Sovereign wags a long finger. “Strange. Your heart gives you
away.”
      I clear my mind. Let it all fade. Imagine the mines. Remember the
wind moving through them. Remember her hands on mine as we walked
barefoot through cold dirt to the place where we first lay together in the
hollow of an abandoned township. Her whispers. How she sang the lullaby
my mother sang my siblings and me.
      “Fifty-five, forty-two, thirty-nine,” Aja says.
      “Is Augustus Ares?” she asks.
      Relief floods me. “No. He’s not Ares.”
      The door slams open behind me. We turn to see Mustang stalking into
the room wearing the gold and white uniform of House Lune. A datapad
glows on her wrist. She bows to the Sovereign. “My liege.”
      “Virginia, you’re still a mess,” Aja drawls.
      “Blame this dumb son of a bitch.” Mustang nods to me. “Seventy-three
dead. Two Earthborn families erased, neither of which had anything to do
with Bellona or Augustus. Over two hundred wounded.” She shakes her
head. “I grounded all ships as you asked, Octavia. Praetorian command has
initiated a no-fly zone in orbit. All family-owned capital ships have had
their warrants revoked and are being pushed beyond the Rubicon Beacons
till we give further notice. And Cassius still lives. He’s with the Yellows.
Citadel Carvers are preparing plans for replacing the arm.”
      The Sovereign thanks her and asks her to sit. “Darrow and I are getting
to know one another. Are there any questions you think we should ask
him?”
      Mustang sits beside the Sovereign.
      “My advice, my liege? Don’t try to solve Darrow. He’s a puzzle with
missing pieces.”
      “That’s rather offensive,” I say.
      “So you don’t think we should keep him?”
      “Cassius and his mother will—” Mustang starts.
      “Will what?” the Sovereign interrupts. “I made Cassius an Olympic
Knight. He will be grateful, and he will study his razor so this does not
happen again.” Her face softens and she touches Mustang’s knee. “Are you
all right, my dear?”
      “I’m fine. Seems like I interrupted your game.”
      I can’t tell which woman is playing the other. But with Karnus’s words
at the gala, and the knowledge that the ships were grounded before I even
started the skirmish, I know the Sovereign had plans. And now I think I can
piece together just what they were.
      “One last question. I’ve been saving it for the end.”
      “Do ask, boy. We have no secrets here. But it must be the last. After
this, I have some words for Agrippina au Julii.” Aja opens the box back up
for the Oracles to go back inside.
      “Tonight, at the gala, during the sixth course of the meal, did you plan
to allow the Bellona to assassinate ArchGovernor Augustus and all those
who sat at his table?”
      Aja freezes. Mustang slowly turns to look at the Sovereign, whose face
shows no hints of dishonesty. The woman breathes easily and with a soft
smile lies through her teeth. “No,” she says. “I did not.”
      The Oracle strikes at her.
16
The Game

      Fitchner’s razor buzzes, and he chops away the tail faster than a bee
beats its wings. It flops to the floor, transparent stinger hissing out poison.
On the Sovereign’s arm, the wounded creature screams. Wailing and
writhing like a dying cat. The Sovereign rips it off and throws it at the wall.
My own releases slowly, as if connected with the other. Mewing
pathetically, it retreats to its box to hide in the darkness. I dab away the faint
trail of blood it left on my forearm.
      “So you do lie,” I say with a wicked grin.
      The Sovereign exhales a long sigh.
      Mustang stands, enraged. “You promised you would not hurt them.
You lied.”
      “Yes.” Octavia rubs her temples. “Yes, I lied.”
      “You said there were no lies here,” Mustang hisses. “That was a
precondition of my allegiance to you. The only thing I asked for, and you
planned to do it while I watched?”
      “Sit.” The Sovereign stands, drawing nose-to-nose with Mustang. “Sit
down.”
      Mustang sits, breathing heavily. She won’t look at me or the
Sovereign. She’s surrounded by betrayal. The Sovereign notes this, piecing
together a new strategy as Mustang draws a gold ring from her pocket and
rolls it compulsively through her fingers.
      “Do you know why I need your family gone?” Octavia asks Mustang.
She doesn’t reply. “I asked you a question, Virginia. Put aside petulance and
answer.”
      “He is a threat to peace,” Mustang replies flatly, slipping the ring on
her finger. “He disregards your orders. He does not obey financial
directives. He delays helium-3 quotas.”
      “If I tried removing him from power, what would happen?”
      Mustang looks up at her. “He would rebel.”
      “So what am I to do? If he rebels while on Mars, it becomes his planet
fortress. The monies it would take me to pry him out—to find him, to kill
him, to reinstate order—is … incomprehensible. Ships. Men. Food.
Munitions. Trade. Helium-3 shortages. The Society would not recover for
years.
      “We cannot afford an enemy like him. But we also cannot afford an
ally to so publicly affront us. What if the Governors of the Gas Giants
thought they were immune to my orders because we’re lenient with your
father? Because we let him manipulate helium prices or ignore Sovereign
directives? Sixty years ago, in the first year of my reign, the Moons of
Saturn rebelled. The war did not end until I destroyed the moon, Rhea,
outright. Fifty million dead. That is how stubborn our race is. They know
how difficult it is for me to flex my hand billions of kilometers from the
Core. But still they are afraid. So much of a ruler’s reign is a figment of the
people’s imagination. My power isn’t ships. Isn’t Praetorians. My power is
their fear. But they must have fresh reminders.
      “And so my family was the reminder.”
      “Yes. Tell me that doesn’t make sense.”
      Mustang stays quiet for a long moment. “It is the logical political
move. But he’s my father …”
      “Then also consider this.”
      She waves her hand and a holo ignites on the floor, rising to fill half
the room. It’s a riot. Buildings smoke. Grays mow down women and men
with pulse weapons. She changes the image. A dozen more dance across the
room. A woman falls in front of me, dead. Hole in her skull. Smoking still.
      I stare down at the sudden horror.
      “Is this Mars?” I ask, fearing for my family.
      “You would think so, wouldn’t you?” The Sovereign traces a finger
through the muzzle of a pulseRifle as it fires. “It’s Venus.”
      “Venus?” Mustang whispers. “There are no Sons of Ares on Venus.”
      “Nor will there be after tonight. The flame spreads even to the Core.
Two hours ago, multiple bombings racked this Society. My Politicos and
Praetors and various high-level personnel throughout the empire have
initiated Order Zero. No media will report this. Wherever there are flames,
we make quarantine. We will snuff them out. Something your father did not
do, Mustang. In fact, he allowed the Sons to thrive. To spread here.”
      I warned Harmony. I only hope the Sons aren’t all lost.
      The Sovereign crouches in front of Mustang. “Your father must die. He
hanged the very woman the Sons of Ares used to start all this. His face
burns across their propaganda. If he goes, if we strike them, then they fade.
We will kill two birds with one stone. Arrange the transfer of power to
Bellona, and Mars is at peace for the first time in my reign. All it costs is
fifty lives. I know he is your father, but you came into my fold for a
reason.”
      Looking at Mutang, I understand that reason now, and it breaks my
heart.
      She stands slowly, walking to the window as if fleeing the decision.
She stares out at a ship passing in the distant fog. “When Mother was alive,
he used to ride with me through the forest. We’d stop at this wildblossom
clearing and lay in the red flowers, arms out, pretending we were angels.
That man is dead. Do with the new one as you like.”
17
What the Storm Brings

      The Obsidians escort me to new quarters, Fitchner trailing along
behind, pacing jovially on the marble floors. When we reach my door, he
takes my hand.
      “Well played, boyo. Good reading on her—knowing she wants what
she can’t have. Gorydamn clever. Warms my heart to finally see you
playing the game and winning, you little pisser.” He slugs my shoulder.
“Tomorrow, we’ll go to market and buy you a servant. Pinks. Blues.
Obsidians of your very own. For now … I left you a present.” He gestures
into my room where a lithe Pink lies on the bed. “Enjoy.”
      “You don’t know me at all. Do you?”
      “This is the hand life has dealt you. It’s not a bad hand. Imagine the
things you can do as a personal emissary of the Sovereign. She makes your
Governor look like a small-town slumlord. You have your girl. You have
opportunity. Embrace your new life.”
      The door slams.
      A new life, but is it worth the cost? I don’t know what’s happening
with the Sons. That’s something I can’t affect. But he expects me to let
Roque die? To let Tactus and Victra and Theodora perish to Praetorian
death squads?
      I walk around my suite, ignoring the Pink. Luna’s night clouds sprawl
far as the eye can see beyond the huge bank of windows that comprises the
suite’s north wall. Buildings puncture the clouds like glittering spears.
      I am trapped by opulence.
      Rain continues to pour. The storms of Luna are enigmatic creatures.
For a man of Mars, it is a slow rain. Lethargic. As though the drops tire of
their own fall in this low gravity. But the winds that come are gales. There
are no cracks in the Citadel’s windows through which the wind can whistle.
I miss the moans of my old castle on Mars. Miss the laments of the
deepmines. Those moments when the drill cooled and I sat there touching
my wedding band through my frysuit, thinking of how soon it would be that
I had her lips to mine, her hands on my waist, her body drifting light as dust
over my own.
      I cannot think only of the Red girl. When I see the moon, I think of the
sun: Mustang burns in my thoughts. If Eo smelled of rust and soil, then the
Golden girl was of fire and autumn leaves.
      Part of me wishes I would only remember Eo. That my mind belonged
to her, so I could be like one of those knights of legend. A man so in love
with one lost that he closes his heart to all others. But I am not that legend.
In so many ways, I’m still a boy, lost and afraid, seeking warmth and love.
When I feel dirt, I honor Eo. And when I see fire, I remember the warmth
and flicker of the flames across Mustang’s skin as we lay in our chamber of
ice and snow.
      I examine the empty room, which smells neither of leaves nor soil, but
cardamom. The room is too vast for my taste. Too rich. There is ivory on
the walls. A sauna. A massage parlor adjacent to a pleasureChamber.
There’s a commChair, a bed, a small swimming pool. These are my
chambers now. I see on a dataFile that I’ve been given a fifty-million-credit
stipend to choose my attendants. They left me an additional ten million to
populate my harem. This is the price they pay me for betraying my friends.
It is not enough.
      My eyes now fall on the Pink who lies on my bed. Naked, covered
only by a blanket. I threw it on her to mask her form, thinking of poor Evey
when I first saw her. But the longer I look at this new girl, the harder it is to
remember Evey, to remember Eo or Mustang. That’s what Pinks are for, to
help you forget. So effective they even make you forget their own sad
plight. When she grows old, she’ll be sold off from the Citadel staff to some
high-class brothel. And a few more lines will form and she’ll be sold down
the ladder and down the ladder till she has nothing more to give. It happens
to men. It happens to women. And, I’m beginning to realize, it happens to
Golds.
      The Pink asks me to join her. To let her soothe what ails me. I don’t
reply. I sit on the edge of the windowsill, my hands kneading my thighs,
waiting. I don’t have my razor. Obsidians guard the hall outside. The glass
window won’t break by any means I have at my disposal, but I do not
worry. I sit watching the storm, feeling it brew inside myself.
      With a hiss, the door opens. I turn, a smile already cracking my face.
      “Mustang, I—”
      Through the door slips a demure male Pink with white hair and eyes
that’d break a thousand hearts in Lykos. It breaks mine now. I was wrong.
      “Who are you?” I ask.
      He sets a small onyx box down on my bed in front of the other Pink.
      “Who is it from?” I demand.
      “You’ll see, dominus,” he says. Daintily, he extends a hand to the other
Pink, who, confused, takes it and follows him from the room. The door
closes. I’m just as confused as the Pink. I rush to the box, opening it, and
find a small holoCube. I activate it.
      Mustang’s face appears, glowing. “Take cover,” she says.
      The power goes out and the door locks by default. The room is
plunged into darkness. Lightning lashes through the clouds outside; thunder
rumbles. And I hear something. A howling. It is not the wind.
      Another flash of lightning and he appears, floating in the bitter storm
like the ugliest angel ever shit out of heaven. A wolfpelt hangs from his
shoulders, whips in the wind. His black metal helmet is that of a wolfshead,
and he’s armed to the bloody teeth.
      Sevro has come, and he’s brought friends.
      Lightning. Thunder again and this time it illuminates his slash of a
smile and the eight floating killers behind him. Nine Howlers in all. Small,
cruel little devils waiting in the darkness, silhouetted by the crackling of the
storm’s electricity. Long-legged Quinn is there too.
      I duck into the sauna as Sevro touches the glass with a pulseFist after
setting up a jamField to absorb the sound. The glass ruptures inward. The
distorted sound of the storm follows them as they thump down onto the
carpeted marble floor. Wind whips at my bedsheets and tapestries. One by
one they kneel—pudgy Pebble, cruel Harpy, spindly, open-faced Clown,
and all the others.
      “Friends. Get up!” I bellow. “You’re already short enough.”
      They laugh and rise. Pebble and Clown rush forward and weld shut my
metal door with plasma torches.
      Water drips from Sevro’s hook nose as he nods toward me, his helmet
absorbed into his armor. Hair buzzed in the shape of dragons. Quiet, and so
full of derision, he hefts a huge, heavy bag in his other hand. And when he
walks, he moves with disdain for this low gravity. As though it were a thing
for weaklings and fools.
      “Lord Reaper. You look like a Pixie ponce in this lady-den.” Sevro
sweeps into a theatrical bow after he places the bag at my feet. “Perhaps
that’s why Mustang believed you were in dire need of your gorydamn
pack.”
      “She brought you back from the Rim?”
      “All of us,” Quinn says. “We’ve been here several weeks on standby.
She needed men she knew wouldn’t be loyal to the Sovereign.”
      An insurance policy. I can’t believe I ever doubted her.
      In no world would Mustang help kill her father. I realized during my
conversation with the Sovereign that it had to be why she’s here in first
place—to infiltrate the Sovereign’s family like I infiltrated the Golds. As
she entered the Sovereign’s suite, I remembered how before the duel she
mentioned having her own plans. Now it finally clicks into place. They
were both playing their own games, but I helped reveal the Sovereign’s
hand.
      The Sovereign wasn’t worried about me knowing anything, else why
play the game? But as soon as Mustang entered the room, the paradigm
altered. She should have concluded the game then and there. But her pride
got the better of her.
      As for Mustang, I knew she was with me as soon as she took the gold
horse ring I gave her from her pocket and slipped it onto her finger. My
heart leaped in that moment, and I knew she’d find our way out of this.
      “Sevro.” I smile and clasp his hand. “Our ArchGovernor is—”
      “I know. Mustang briefed us.”
      “Come here, you tall devil.” Quinn steps past the others and slips her
thin arm around my waist and kisses my cheek. She smells like home. I
have missed these people. The wind howls as it passes through our
jamField. Sevro’s bionic eye glitters unnaturally in his pale face. Quinn has
brought me gravBoots, ebony in color. I slip them on.
      “Mustang might have brought us from the Rim. But we didn’t come
for her. We didn’t come for Augustus. We came for you, Reaper,” Sevro
snarls. Quinn frowns as Sevro spits on the pretty carpet. “We saw what you
did to Cassius. And we want what you’re trying to make.”
      “And that is?” I ask, more than a little confused.
      “What poor killers always want. War,” he growls. “And all its spoils.”
      “What of your father? He has a high place now.”
      “Fitchner is a shiteater,” he sneers. “He’s made his bed. Let him sleep
in it while we burn the house down.”
      “Well, if you want war, if you want spoils, we better move. The
ArchGovernor’s the one with an army.”
      Quinn nods. “And Roque’s down there. And Tactus.”
      “Tactus,” Sevro mutters, though I know the sneer on his face is for
Roque. He watches Quinn, eyes sad for the smallest moment, before
adjusting his armor.
      “So what’s the plan?” I ask as I pull on the gravBoots and take the
razor Pebble tosses me.
      Sevro and Quinn look at each other and laugh. “Mustang’s fetching a
ship. She said you’d figure the rest out,” Quinn says.
      Just then the door behind me shudders and glows with a dilating pupil
of red-hot metal. I slip the boots on, and as I do, I notice something. The
bag that Sevro threw down. It moves.
      Sevro smiles at me. I know that smile.
      “Sevro?”
      “Reaper.”
      “What did you do?”
      “Mustang brought us a package. Let’s just say”—Quinn grins at my
shoulder—“it’s not their cook.”
      I unzip the bag and gawk.
      “Are you mad?” I ask him.
      He just howls.
18
Bloodstains

      Father once told me that a Helldiver can never stop. You stop and the
drill can jam. The fuel burns too quickly. The quota might be missed. You
never stop, just shift drills if the friction gets too hot. Caution comes
second. Use your inertia, your momentum. That is why we dance. Transfer
movement into more movement. Uncle Narol always told me to stop. He
was wrong. Blew so many drill bits because of him.
      Then again, Narol lived longer than Father, so maybe he has a point.
      My Howlers jump with me out the window and we don’t stop when we
dive into the black storm. We freefall, piercing the clouds without the use of
our gravBoots. Like black rain screaming toward the ground. I’m first. I
feel them behind me. My Howlers. The oxygen is thin at first. I hold my
breath. My eyeballs nearly freeze in their sockets. Tears trickle out. My
body shivers as the cold wind bites me.
      We use our gravBoots now to cut across the Citadel. Skirt amongst the
clouds to keep from sight. Villas beneath. Buildings, gardens, and parks.
Barracks and statued plazas. A ripWing cuts through the sky. We slide
behind a spire and stick there like spiders till our scanners say he’s passed. I
shiver amidst my armored friends. Then we float down again. A kilometer
from the villa. Weed carries Sevro’s present now. Slung around his back, it
weighs him down a bit.
      I land on the wall that surrounds the villa and separates it from the
other compounds where the other notable families hunker in fear of what
the night brings.
      It’s warmer now we’re lower to the ground. Howlers land around me,
looking like gargoyles on the wall. Darkness claims the villa’s grounds.
      “We’re early?” I wonder. No signs of fighting. But the lights are out.
      “Or late,” Sevro says, “if they were murdered in their beds.”
      “They’re not stupid,” I say. “They wouldn’t just wait to be killed. This
is to look like a Bellona massacre. The Sovereign won’t want to be
implicated.” But what does that even mean? The Bellona would come with
Grays, Obsidians, Golds, and despite all their vaunted honor, they would
destroy every last woman and child with any means at their disposal. You
do not let your foot off the throat of an enemy and remain powerful, as they
have, for hundreds of years.
      The killing will be silent, though. The Sovereign may control the
Citadel, but chaos would bring unwelcome eyes, unwelcome variables, and
it would make her look weak. Better to have the act done. Better to say the
Bellona did it and damn what anyone thinks. With the Augustans dead,
what is the point to mourning them? That’s how Golds think. But if they are
alive having escaped assassination … well, that’s another thing entirely.
      “Quinn.” I lean close so I can hear her whisper.
      “Visual is too clear. If they have optics, they’ll spot us up on the wall.”
She points to the roof. “We can make an incursion there. Sweep down level
by level.” I hear the worry in her voice.
      “We’ll get Roque,” I say. “Promise.” I pat her arm. “Sevro, how long
till we have the shuttle?”
      “Mustang is ten out,” Sevro says.
      I pop my neck and rub the rain between my fingers. “Per aspera ad
astra.”
      “Through the thorns to the stars,” Sevro snickers. “You fancy little fart.
Omnis vir lupus.” Everyone a wolf. The Howlers flash smiles to one
another, and we rip away from the wall.
      We land on the roof. Silent and dark. Weed stays on the high wall with
Mustang’s present squirming in the bag. Predators, we stalk over clay tiles
in through a window on the villa’s seventh level, two at a time. The place is
a complex. Dozens of rooms. Seven levels. Fountains running throughout.
Baths. Basement. Steam rooms. Their infrared is worthless, then. Too much
hot water going through pipes. It’s quiet as a crypt in here.
      We creep along, checking the bedrooms, flowing like water around one
another as we did at the Institute. Sevro and Thistle ghost ahead, scouting.
GravBoots deactivated so the hum can’t be heard. There’s not a soul to be
seen. Every room empty, beds unmade, including the ArchGovernor’s. The
Augustans are not here. So where are they?
      They’ve no military armaments besides some armor and razors and a
few pulseFists. The bodyguards were wiped out before they even returned
to the villa. Augustus and his entourage couldn’t have climbed the walls.
Perhaps they flew away on gravBoots? But they would have been spotted.
Shot down. We only slipped in because we’re unexpected.
     “Captured?” Sevro asks.
     No. For the Praetorians tonight, the only good Augustan is a dead one.
     Pop.
     We all look at one another. A jamField has just gone up. A big one.
We’re inside it. Likely, the whole villa complex is inside it. Something’s
about to happen. I glance out the window and see a shadow moving across
the garden lawn. Three shadows in the rain. I duck and signal Sevro.
Praetorians. GhostCloaks. My heart makes my rib cage rattle.
     He moves to the window, about to jump out to try and kill them. I pull
him back.
     “What the hell are you doing?” I whisper.
     He scowls. “I want to kill someone.”
     “Not yet, dammit. We’re not an army.”
     No one on the seventh level. We go down a circular marble stairwell.
Their oiled armor creaks softly, echoing down the cavernous stairwell. We
can see the marble of the first level more than a hundred feet beneath, but
no movement. The first blood is found on the sixth level, seeping from the
steam room. Pull the door open, heart throbbing into my throat, ready to see
mutilated Golds. It’s a sadder sight.
     More than twenty Pinks, Browns, and Violets thought to hide in this
room. The Bellona and Praetorians found them. Killed them. It is a queer
sight. Each death so clean. Jab wounds to the skull. Just shows how little
chance these poor servants had. The Golds put them down like cattle. I
search through them frantically, hoping not to find her. Praying. She’s not
here— Theodora must be with the rest of them.
     A cold rage fills me. I feel it seep into the Howlers.
     We find the first dead Gold at the stairwell down to the fifth floor. An
old knight of my house. His death was not pretty. We find another dead man
further on by a gravLift. He fell as if defending the lift while others
descended.
     Out the window, I glimpse the Augustan lancer who mocked my skills
with the razor on the shuttle down. She rushes from the house to the
gardens. A shape coalesces out of the darkness. A Gold Praetorian with
purple fringe to his black armor chases her down. Two Bellona Obsidians
hem her in, forcing her to turn straight into her pursuer. He kills her with
one swing. Nothing to be done. Her death is so fast. One moment she is
panting, fearing, running. The next, both parts of her fall to the ground.
      “These Praetorian don’t play with their food,” Sevro mutters. Quinn
looks at me, her eyes tracing the absence of armor or a helmet to give me
protection. She offers her own. I ignore her.
      “Darrow, we didn’t come all this way to watch you die of a blow to the
head.”
      “Get off it,” I say to her. “Roque will write a thousand gory poems if
you get so much as a bump on yours.”
      “Keep the helmet, Q,” Sevro begs. “If only because I hate poems.”
      I let my borrowed razor slither into my palm and move through the
level. At the door of each room, my blood races. I expect to find Roque’s
corpse. Expect to see Victra’s mangled body.
      Sevro holds up a hand at the fourth-floor stairwell and motions me
forward. I slip toward him with Quinn and peer down. Dust rises up the
circular stairwell. Beyond it, on the bottom-floor landing, shadows move.
But there is no noise. Sevro bends and places a piece of debris on the edge
of a banister, gesturing me to watch. The Howlers cluster around, staring at
it, and I stiffen. Though there is no sound, the piece of debris rocks slightly.
      Vibrations in the building.
      Before Sevro and the others can stop me, I jump over the banister and
rip down the center of the spiral stairwell with ten times the velocity this
moon’s gravity would allow. Pop. I enter the domain of a second jamField,
and sounds of war rattle over me. Concussive blasts, yelling, burners
hissing out bullets, pulse weapons warbling like demented ghosts. The
moment before I land, I tweak my gravBoots, jerking myself to a powerful
stop. I slap into the marble and swing my razor around my head in a violent
loop. Four Praetorian Grays die. Eight thumps hitting the floor. Their
ghostCloaks disintegrate like thin window frost against hot breath.
      Bodies, strewn across the halls. Rubble. Fires. Grays and Obsidians
chase down Augustan Golds. Six Grays overwhelm two Golds with
railRifles, magnetic ammunition screaming into aegises till they overload
and warp backward, consuming the Golds’ left arms. Rounds slap into the
pulseShields that cover their body’s, overloading the circuitry. The Grays
slip forward with practiced precision and shoot the Golds point-blank in
their helmeted heads. The best armor in the Solar System crumples inward
and the man and woman are gone. The Grays turn in my direction, level
their rifles, and my Howlers cascade down around me. Their black aegises
throb against the vambraces that cover their left forearms. They block the
incoming fire. Sevro slips from formation. Quinn follows. Ghosting, they
flicker in and out of sight, moving as twin strands of smoke. Somehow
they’re amongst the Grays, then back by my side before the Grays fall.
     More weaponfire slams into our formation, nearly taking my naked
head off. I duck behind my armored fellows. Terror pumps through me. A
Gray pops into the hall and fires a microShot at us. Thirty tiny bombs
spread out like a swarm of hornets. Thistle and Rotback blast the swarm
apart with their pulseFists. A sheet of blue fire billows through the hall. A
second swarm of bombs howls after the first. Quinn shunts off the power to
her gravFist and shoots at the swarm of bombs just before they hit. They
reverse course, back the way they came, where they slap into the Gray
squad and detonate.
     We won’t last in here. Nothing will, I decide when three Bellona
Obsidians lope into view, Karnus au Bellona following at their heels. Some
of my friends will die on this level if we fight all who come against us.
There’s a better way. A smarter way.
     “Sevro, make a hole!” I shout, pointing seven stories above us, up the
center gap in the stairwell. He shoots his pulseFist upward and chunks of
stone rain down around us, suspended by Quinn’s gravFist. Sevro shoots
again and water rains down through the hole, swirling in the gravity bubble
Quinn created. I stand and yell, “On me!”
     We ascend out of the chaos before the Praetorians fall on us. I come to
a halt two hundred meters above the villa. Wind whips. I had no plan when
I dove down to the first level. I thought only of my friends. Now I know the
Howlers and I will be killed if we fight. I let my razor curl placidly around
my arm. I instruct the Howlers to do the same and I roar into the darkness.
     “AJA!” The Howlers close around me, nervous as we float exposed
above the villa. The storm sends sheets of rain down on us. “AJA!”
     A horde of Praetorians disengage their ghostCloaks near the hot
springs and lagoon, where the infrared is thrown into chaos by the heat of
the water. Two Praetorians rocket up from the garden, cutting through pine
trees, one a Stained. He flies closer, leveling his ionFist at my head.
     “Get that thing out of my gorydamn face, you Stained whelp. Don’t
you recognize your betters?” A Praetorian Gold joins him. I don’t recognize
the woman. Her serpent helm recoils into her purple-black armor, sleeker
than the Obsidians’. Face sharp and ruthless as an axehead.
      “Varga, heel,” she snaps. The Stained lowers his weapon. His helmet
slides into his own Praetorian armor, and I discover Varga is a she. An
Obsidian two feet taller than I, with a tribal skull tattoo consuming her pale
face. White hair flutters behind her. More scars on her face than I have on
my entire body.
      “Ebony dog,” Sevro snaps. “I’ll shoot her if she snarls again.”
      “Were you the squad in the stairwell?” The Gold glances over us,
unsure of what to make of me or my Howlers. “You killed my Grays.”
      “Don’t weep over Grays,” I say. “They raised their hands against me.”
      “Why are you here?” She wipes the rain from her face. “The Sovereign
confined you to your room for the night. Are you responsible for the power
outage?”
      “My business is the Sovereign’s.” She can’t afford not to believe me.
      She pauses a beat and I realize she has optics in her eyes. She checks a
database “Liar.”
      The Stained’s weapon comes back up.
      “You know who I am, Praetorian,” I say with as much authority as I
can muster. “You also know I’m not on your list to kill. I have immunity.”
      “Revoked.”
      “So take me to Aja.”
      “Aja isn’t here.”
      “Don’t lie to me.”
      Her optics flicker in her irises as she receives a digital command.
“Follow me.”
      We land on white stones and follow the Praetorian through the trees
toward the lagoon where the hot springs terminate.
      “What are you doing?” Sevro whispers in my ear, eyeing Varga. He
flips the woman the crux with his middle finger wrapped around the index.
      “I’m using your leverage.”
      Aja stands in the garden, flanked by Bellona—two Gold, the rest
Obsidian. Only the one Stained, Varga. The lagoon breathes tendrils of
steam around the Protean Knight’s shoulders. She watches the water
impassively, like a child watching a campfire, waiting for a log to burn in
half.
      “Darrow?” Aja purrs without looking at me. “You’re not in your
room.” She sizes up the Howlers. Recognizes them. “And you killed my
men. Fitchner was wrong about you.”
      “I have something you’ll want,” I say sharply. “But call off your
dogs.”
      “They tried to escape before we came, even with their gravBoots
confiscated. Foolish attempt. They tried to contact the Julii, but they’ve
been bought.”
      “Victra?” I ask. She betrayed us.
      “Alive. With the rest. She’ll be spared thanks to her mother’s
cooperation. Two Augustan ships made effort to run our blockade in orbit.
We shot them down. The Augustans are like cornered badgers.”
      “Lions,” I remind her.
      She flicks blood off her razor. “Not quite.”
      “Are any still alive?” I keep the panic from my voice and glance back
at the villa.
      “The prizes are.”
      I breathe a sigh of relief.
      She lets her razor slither into hand. It goes rigid and she turns my way.
Slitted pupils drink in the light. “Your friends are in the lagoon. They hid
there because our infrared is blinded by the pool’s heat. A desperate last
attempt. The air filtration systems on their helmets will have short-circuited
from the EMP. So all they’ll have is the air in their helmets. Not much of it
either. They won’t last fifteen minutes. Those who don’t have helmets …
perhaps six minutes. Soon they’ll bob up, like apples.” She smiles
pleasantly. “I’m saving them for Karnus; he is inside finishing up the
diversions. He’s a pleasure to watch, isn’t he?”
      Hot rain clatters on our armor. The only sound.
      “Why are you here, Andromedus, and not in your rooms?” Aja plays
with her razor, slicing raindrops in half. “The Sovereign was very clear.”
      “I have something you’ll want,” I repeat.
      “What I want is for Octavia to be obeyed. Fly back to your room, boy,
and take a nice shower and fondle the Rose we left in your bed. Drain your
anger or whatever this is into her. And leave your oath whole. Do not raise a
finger against me. You have killed Grays only. That is easily forgotten, yes?
Return, and she will think this only a flight of youth. Stay, and I will add
your corpse and those of your Bronzie friends to the heap.
      The Howlers bristle behind me.
      “As you killed the servants?” I ask heatedly. “Like goats for
slaughter.”
      Aja turns back to the pool. “It’s time you left, Reaper.”
      “You’re disgusting.” I step closer to her. “All this power, and this is
how you use it? Killing families in the middle of the gorydamn night. Base
fact is, you’re a disgrace. I hope you remember the pain you brought others
when I stand over your corpse.”
      She turns on me in all her fury. Razor snapping out. Eyes gleaming.
But she can’t touch me. Not now. Not this night.
      “Darrow,” Sevro calls with a sudden, odd pleasantness to his voice.
      “Yes, Sevro?”
      “All that talk about remembering. Aren’t you forgetting something
right now?”
      “I think he is,” Quinn agrees. “Our wise …”
      “… but forgetful Reaper,” finishes Clown in a very frivolous fashion.
      “Hmmm. Apologies, Aja. I forgot what I even came here to tell you.” I
stand there looking flummoxed.
      Quinn sighs. “The bag.”
      “Oh, yes! Thank you for reminding me, Sevro!” I cry theatrically. Aja
doesn’t know what the hell to make of this sudden banter. “Tell Weed to get
down here.”
      Sevro speaks into his com and a moment later Weed disengages his
ghostCloak and flies from the wall a kilometer distant. We watch him
approach. Pebble whistles a merry tune, earning a scowl from Harpy and a
chuckle from Sevro, who picks it up as well. The Praetorians think they are
insane. Wolfpelts hanging from their backs. Black, custom armor. Wolf
helmets. And no one over two meters except for Quinn and I. It’s like a
Violet traveling circus.
      “What are you playing at?” Aja demands.
      “Has no one ever bartered with you?” I ask, surprised. “More’s the
pity.”
      Weed lands in front of me and hands me the bag Sevro gave me as a
present. Aja asks what is in the bag.
      “Tell your men in the villa to stop the killing, and I will tell you.”
      “I don’t negotiate with boys,” Aja says.
      I nudge the bag lightly with my boot, showing Aja that whatever is
inside is alive. She frowns and perhaps she begins to understand what it is.
She speaks in her com for her men to stand down. “What’s in the gorydamn
bag?”
      I open it up and pull out the heir to the Morning Throne like he’s a
freshly caught rabbit. Lysander’s hands and feet are bound gently, and a silk
scarf has been tied over his mouth to keep him from making noise. I untie
it.
      “Hello, Aja,” he says.
      Aja lunges at him. I pull him backward. “Ah! Ah!” I hold my razor to
the boy’s neck, letting it curl around, just as the affectionate Oracle wrapped
itself around my wrist. Aja freezes. Her Praetorians watch quietly—black
helmets and purple capes making them shadows. The few Bellona take
steps forward. Aja motions them back. “Next person that moves, I cut them
down. How did they get you, Lysander? Your guards …”
      “It was Mustang,” he says. “Came to say hello. Cut open my window
and gave me to the Howlers.”
      “Have you been hurt?”
      “Your turn to speak is at an end,” I interrupt. “You will let my
Housemembers rise from the pool. You will let them board the shuttle I
have inbound. You will tell the ripWings and fighters in the sky and space
above Luna to let us pass. Or I will have my Howlers kill the boy.
      “You promised to protect the Sovereign,” Aja whispers. “And you do
… this? He is a boy. He is helpless.”
      “It’s part of the game,” Lysander says very seriously. “You play it too,
Aja. We’re all on the board.”
      “You see, he’s less helpless than the servants you slaughtered tonight,”
Quinn replies. “Less than those your father burned on Rhea. But he’s one of
yours. So of course you care.”
      “You would kill a family to ensure the safety of your Sovereign,” I say
coldly. “I would kill a child to ensure the safety of my friends. Speak again,
and I take his left hand.”
      She knows I would kill the boy.
      I know I would not. I’m not Karnus. Not Evey or Harmony, despite
what I’d have these Golds think. So even if they called my bluff, I would
balk. Anyway, the moment I kill him, they kill everyone I know. The
murder would be in vain.
      This is exactly why I build my reputation as a killer, to leverage in
situations like these. If they knew my heart, they’d kill my friends one by
one. This is a gamble.
     I gamble on pride of two sorts. The first pride is that the Sovereign will
not let me kill her only grandson, whom she trained from childhood to take
her place when the time comes. The second sort of pride is that deep down,
she will believe it no great loss if Augustus and his family escape today.
She has the will and the means to hunt us to the ends of the System. Why
call my bluff and risk having her grandson die? I know this because of how
she killed her father—not outright, but only when she had the support of all
his former followers, only when they asked her to rise up against the tall
tyrant and rule in his stead.
     A woman like her has patience. If the Sovereign told me to do my
worst, if she shouted to kill the boy and suffer the consequences, that would
be foolhardy. A blunt, brutish demonstration of power, as if saying ‘Take
my son, you cannot hurt me.’ No, instead she will feign weakness, let me
have this victory, and then bring eternal ruin on me and mine. Fair enough.
We’ll play that game another day.
     A ship roars overhead. A stork—built to deploy men in starShells to
drop points, but slower than molasses sliding uphill. The bay doors open
two hundred meters up, as I instructed. So long as we have the boy, the
ship’s speed doesn’t matter a lick. Of course Mustang planned that.
     “We’re going to fetch our people now, Aja. Let your men know they’re
to do nothing to impede us.”
     Aja just stares at me, watching like a taunted panther in a zoo, eyes
silent, horrible, as if willing the bars between us to disappear.
     “Sevro, Thistle, check the villa. See if anyone managed to survive.”
They shoot away. “Quinn, guard the boy. The rest of you, get the
ArchGovernor and his retinue out of the pool.
     “You’ll want to call off the ripWings,” I say to Aja. They blink in the
darkness kilometers above. “Too much noise and this whole thing will turn
into a nightmare for all of us. The Sovereign massacring a house … but the
house escapes! What a dastardly testament to her hunger, her impotence.
What a debacle that might cause.” I smirk at her. “Why, I fear some houses
might rally around the offended house. Some may fear they too will be
snuffed out like candles in the night. What would happen to the poor Pax
Solaris then?”
     Quinn stays with me, fingers twitching toward her weapons as Aja
obeys my commands. I keep my hand on the boy as the other Howlers
splash into the water and emerge with members of House Augustus clinging
to them, soaked and gasping for air—some in formal wear, some in armor,
most without helmets. They were sharing oxygen, it seems.
     Augustus holds on to Harpy’s back. The Jackal holds on to Clown’s
arm. Pliny hangs on to his feet. Where are my friends?
     The Howlers deposit the survivors into the bay of the hovering stork
high above and return to fetch the rest. Victra is the next they bring out.
She’s helmetless and wounded on her neck. But she clings to her razor as
though it were the thing carrying her aloft. Her eyes strafe the gathered
Praetorians wrathfully, and when they find me, they spark against mine like
bits of flint. Her anger falls away for a moment and I see a smile of joy,
then it’s gone and she shouts.
     “I will remember you all with great joy!” She laughs madly. “Starting
with you, Aja au Grimmus. I will make a coat of your hide.”
     She disappears into the belly of the craft overhead. Roque is the next
one borne aloft. Theodora is with him. I say a quiet prayer of thanks. Quinn
touches my shoulder and gives him a wave. His thin face bursts into a smile
at the sight of her. He doesn’t even notice me. Then he’s gone too, landing
in the back of the ship. Thistle soon joins us from the manor, helping along
several survivors, including the Telemanuses and Tactus, who bleeds from a
dozen holes in his gold armor. He put up a nasty fight.
     “Darrow?” he cries. “You mad bastard!” He sees the Sovereign’s son
and cackles gleefully. “Oh, that’s ripe. That’s ripe. I owe you a drink, my
goodman …” His voice fades away as he slips higher in the sky, though he
managed to throw his fingers into the crux and wave them in Aja’s
direction.
     “Tactus,” Lysander whispers. “He’s taller than in holos.”
     “That’s the last of them,” Sevro says to me.
     “Tell your master we of Mars do not bow so easily,” I say to Aja.
     The rain beats down between us. Dripping over her dark face, so her
eerie eyes blaze in the night. She breaks the silence I imposed on her.
     “That is what the Governor of Rhea said when my Ash Lord came to
put down his rebellion.” Her voice does not sound like her own. It’s as
though someone speaks through her. “He looked at the thin man I sent with
the armada and he laughed and asked why he should bow to me, the bitch
patricide of a dead tyrant.”
     The Sovereign is speaking in Aja’s ear, through her com, with Aja
repeating the words. My blood runs cold.
      “The Governor of Rhea sat upon his Ice Throne in his famed Glass
Palace and asked one of my servants, ‘Who are you to breathe fear into a
man such as I? I who have descended from the family that carved heaven
from a place where once there was nothing but a hell of ice and stone. Who
are you to make me bow?’ Then he struck the Ash Lord here under the eye
with his scepter. ‘Go home to Luna. Go home to the Core. The Outer Reach
is for creatures of sterner spines.’ The Governor of Rhea did not bow. Now
his moon is ash. His family is ash. He is ash. So run, Darrow au
Andromedus. Run home to Mars, for my legions will follow you to the ends
of this universe.”
      “I hope so,” I say.
      “You have one bargaining chip,” the Sovereign, through Aja, reminds
me. “My grandson is your safe passage. If he dies, I wipe your ship from
the sky. Spend him wisely.”
      Why is she telling me something I already know?
      “It’s time to go, Darrow.” Quinn leans into my shoulder. She sets a
hand on my low back, as if to remind me I am not alone. I nod to her. She
covers my retreat as I rise upward with the boy, razor slithering around his
neck.
      Quinn eyes the Praetorians warily and rises to follow. I have one
bargaining chip.
      What did the Sovereign mean by that? Was she reminding me that I
could only spend it once? Only kill Lysander if my back was to the wall?
Then I see why as Aja looks at Quinn rising from the ground as a cat looks
at a mouse.
      “Aja, no!” Lysander yells.
      “Quinn!” I shout.
      In a flash, Aja lunges forward, quicker than any cat ever born. She
grabs Quinn’s hair. Frantically, Quinn brings her razor around to fend the
giant woman off. But she’s too slow. Aja slams her head into the ground
with her left hand. Punches her temple. Armored fist on bone. Four times
before I can even blink. Quinn’s legs kick and twitch and she curls inward
like a dying spider, contorting from seizures. Aja backs away, watching me
with a smile.
19
Stork

      They know I am rash. This is bait. She is the hook. They’ll take
Lysander if I bite and attack Aja. They’ll use the split second my razor is
away from him to stun or kill me. I hear the weapons primed behind me, so
I keep the razor to the little boy’s throat. Tears distort my vision as I float
there impotently. I shake my head as the agony wells. I can’t leave her.
Reversing my boots, I return to pick her from the ground. But before I can
reach her, another Gold flashes past me, descending from above, this one
without armor, to scoop her from the ground and bear her aloft.
      The Jackal.
      I shoot up and away, through the rain into the bay doors and land
inside the stork. My boots clank on the metal deck and I kneel, shoving
Lysander forward into the bay toward Sevro. The boy sprawls to his knees.
Several dozen dripping Augustan stand gawping at me. They turn their eyes
to the boy. The Jackal follows, clutching Quinn awkwardly with one arm.
      Our ship rises and the doors hiss closed behind us, sealing away the
cacophony of wind and engine roar. Roque pushes through the others and
stares at me, then his eyes go to the Jackal and Quinn, strength slipping
from him with each second. The Jackal sets Quinn gently on the ground and
kicks off the ill-fitting gravBoots he borrowed from one of the Howlers.
      Roque’s mouth works. No sound comes out. “Is she …,” he murmurs
finally.
      “Are there any Yellows on board?” the Jackal asks me. I look to Harpy.
      I point Harpy toward the main cabins. “Find Mustang. Ask her.”
      She sprints off.
      “The medkit,” the Jackal snaps, feeling Quinn’s pulse. He checks her
pupils. No one moves. “Now!” Roque stumbles up to find it. Pebble rips it
off the wall and tosses him the kit. He brings it back to the Jackal. Mind
turned to static, I stare down at Quinn as another seizure racks her body and
an inhuman sound rattles from her nose and mouth. Roque’s face is
bloodless beside me. His hands reach helplessly for the girl he loves, as
though his will alone can mend what was broken; but inside he knows he is
powerless. He sinks to his knees.
      The Jackal opens the medkit and rifles through its contents.
      His single hand moves confidently over the devices inside till they find
a silver bar no larger than my index finger. He snatches it and activates the
device. It hums softly, emitting a faint blue light.
      “I need someone’s datapad. Mine was fried in the EMP.” No one
moves. “The girl will die. A gorydamn datapad. Now.”
      I hand him mine. He doesn’t look up at me, though he pauses a second
when he sees my distinctive hands.
      “Thank you for the rescue, Reaper,” he says hastily.
      “Thank your sister.”
      Lysander rises and comes to my side. He watches quietly, no tears in
his eyes. Pebble and Clown sit on their heels. No one touches Roque,
though they glance at him, hands clutched on knees or razors, whispering
whatever prayers to luck Golds whisper.
      The Jackal moves the silver magnetic resonance imager over Quinn’s
head, watching the hologram on my datapad. He curses.
      “What is it?” Roque asks.
      The Jackal hesitates. “Her brain is swelling. If we can’t control the
pressure, we have a problem.” He fumbles with the medical equipment and
unwinds a machine with a transparent cord. “That pressure will deprive the
brain of proper blood flow. It will starve itself as the vessels tighten under
the swelling.”
      “Is she going to die?” I ask.
      “Not from swelling,” the Jackal says. “Not if I can drain the fluid and
release the pressure as it builds. But we’ll need to get her head tilted so the
blood can flow through the neck veins. Keep blood pressure steady. Get her
a supply of O2.” He looks up, so thin and wet I’d think him a Red instead of
a Gold were it not for the dusty hair. “Pebble, isn’t it? Find her oxygen. A
breathing mask will do so long as it doesn’t cover her face past her
forehead.”
      Pebble slips away.
      A fresh seizure contorts Quinn’s body. I look on helplessly and set my
hand on Roque’s shoulder. He flinches against the touch at first.
      Harpy slides back into the room. “No slagging Yellows.”
      “Shit,” Clown swears. “Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.” He kicks the wall.
      The Jackal pauses, glances at Roque, then acts. He points to Clown,
Harpy, and several Housemembers. “I need someone for each of her arms
and her head. She’s going to keep seizing, and for some reason, I suspect
this is going to be a bumpy ride. We’re going to move her out of this damn
bay and hold her down for the surgery.” He pulls her hair back into a
ponytail, asks me to hold it, and pulls a small ionizer from the medkit. He
squeezes it with his teeth over his hand, wincing as it destroys bacteria and
dry skin follicles. “Clown, get her hair—all of it.”
      The Jackal stands and tosses the ionizer to Clown, who bends and is
about to scan it over Quinn’s golden hair when Roque takes it from his
grasp. He hovers over Quinn, unable to move.
      “What’s her name?” the Jackal asks Roque.
      “Quinn.”
      “Talk to her. Tell her a story.”
      Trembling slightly, Roque sniffs and speaks quietly to Quinn. “Once,
in the days of Old Earth, there were two pigeons who were greatly in
love.…” He toggles the ionizer and moves his hand. It is intimate. Like he’s
bathing her. Just the two of them in some far-off place. Long before she told
stories by the campfires of the Institute. Long before the horror.
      I smell hair burning as the Jackal stands and comes to me.
      “What happened down there?” he asks. “Was it a pulseFist?”
      I look at him in surprise. “You didn’t see? Aja used her hands.”
      “Goryhell.” His jaw tightens. Dull eyes taking in the scene. “How did
we come to this?”
      “Octavia was set on this path all along,” I say quietly. “Before we even
came to Mars, she intended to give the Bellona the ArchGovernorship. The
gala was a trap.”
      “When did you discover this? Before or after the duel?”
      “Before,” I lie.
      “Well played. Makes us seem the victim. I see Mustang failed in her
task.”
      “Did your father send her to infiltrate Octavia’s court?”
      “No. I imagine it was her own idea. Draw close to the dragon …”
      “The Julii are against us too.
      He nods thoughtfully. “Makes sense. Politicos tried to take Victra from
us before Karnus and Aja came.”
      “You don’t seem worried.”
      “Victra is her mother’s favorite daughter.” He shakes his head,
remembering something. “But she took three Obsidians on for me. Three.
She’s with us, body and mind.”
      I watch Roque finish removing Quinn’s hair. “Will she live?” I ask
quietly.
      “She has bone fragments in her brain tissue. Even if we stop the
swelling, she’s hemorrhaging. Badly.”
      We look down at Quinn, her head bald now. Face peaceful. Only small
contusions on the side of her skull. You’d never guess she was dying inside.
Roque strokes her forehead so gently, whispering soft things.
      “Can you save her?” I turn to the Jackal. “Is there a chance?”
      “Not here. If you get us to a medBay, then yes, there’s a prime
chance.”
      Roque sings a soft song to her as they lift her body to move to another
room. The song is one he made around the campfire as my army ate in the
highlands. Quinn was with Cassius then, as it seems all women are at one
time or another. But even then, I noticed her eyes meet Roque’s. They are
the messenger pigeons from his story, crossing again and again in the sky.
How excited he was to be reunited with her.
      I crack inside. I can still save her. I can fix this.
      The Sovereign was right. I misunderstood my own bargaining power.
What was I going to do? Kill her son if Aja killed Quinn? What if he killed
Sevro, Mustang, Roque? I’m lucky she didn’t hurt more of them.
      I turn to see Sevro.
      He stands quietly in his armor watching us, watching Roque hold the
girl Sevro loves but has never told, the girl he could never have. The pain is
raw and etched deep into the lines of his hawkish face. Impervious Sevro,
immune to hurt, to sadness, to having his eye gouged out by Lilath, the
Jackal’s lieutenant; it all falls on him now. Quinn never called Sevro Goblin
like the rest of us. Victra puts a hand on his shoulder, noticing the pain if
not understanding why it’s there. He shoves her hand off.
      “I don’t know you,” he snarls.
      Victra backs away. “Sorry.”
      “What are you waiting for, Reap?” he demands. “We’re not off this
rock yet.” He jerks his head. I follow, asking Victra to bring the Sovereign’s
boy.
     Sevro and I climb a ladder and meet Tactus in the narrow corridor that
leads to the passenger hold and the flight cabin.
     “Oy, goodman,” Tactus calls, favoring his injured shoulder. Wet hair
dangles over laughing eyes. His voice is loud, unmindful of Quinn’s
condition. “Next time you’re planning something dramatic, tell us you’re
coming so we don’t go pissing our pants.”
     I push past him. “Not now, Tactus.”
     “Ever the bore.” He eyes Sevro. “Looky, looky. Goblin. If possible,
you’ve shrunk even further, my goodman.”
     Sevro doesn’t smile.
     We enter the passenger hold, where the Augustans and Howlers buckle
themselves into bucket seats in preparation for breaching the atmosphere.
Tactus follows at our heels.
     “Hello, psychos,” Tactus calls to the Howlers. “Pleasure to see your
diminutive forms yet again. Especially you, Pebble.”
     “Eat shit,” Pebble says, looking up from helping buckle one of
Augustus’s young nephews into his seat.
     Tactus leans into me when we’re past the passenger hold. “Good
friends to come and rescue you. Thought they were scattered to the Rim.”
     “Were,” Sevro says.
     “What brought you back?” Tactus asks. “The weather?”
     Sevro says nothing.
     Tactus laughs despite the numerous holes in his armor. “Just how you
like ’em. Eh, Darrow? Friends who will risk life and limb to always be in
your shadow?” He nudges me, a bit too playfully, leaving faint smears of
his blood on me. We come to the flight cabin’s closed door. Tactus winces
as he bumps a bulkhead with his shoulder. Sevro trails behind.
     “How’s the shoulder?” I ask.
     “Better than that girl’s head back there. Quinn, wasn’t it? The fast one
from House Mars. Aja slagged her good. Pity. I’d have taken her for a—”
     Sevro kicks Tactus in the balls from behind, foot going between legs
hard enough to dent metal. He elbows him in the side of the head, sweeps
his legs in swift kravat form. Three more strikes to the ears before Tactus
hits the ground. Sevro puts one knee into Tactus’s shoulder wound, a
forearm against Tactus’s throat, the other knee to Tactus’s groin, and his
free hand dangles a knife over Tactus’s eyeball. “Talk about Quinn again,
and I’ll cut your balls off and jam them in your eye sockets.”
       “Brother always said … keep your eye … on the ball,” Tactus gags
out.
      The metal cabin door hisses open. Augustus fills the frame. He stares
down at the scene just as Victra brings Lysander forward from the aft of the
ship.
      “They’re almost done, my liege,” I say. I step over Tactus and Sevro to
join the ArchGovernor in the cabin. Victra does the same, except she steps
on Tactus, grinding her heels.
      “Prime work,” she says to Sevro.
      “Slag off, cow.”
      “Who is the little one?” she asks me as we slip into the cabin and close
the door.
      I tell her.
      “The Rage Knight’s son? Nasty little man. I don’t think he likes me.”
      “Don’t take it personally.”
      The cockpit is larger than my room in the Citadel’s villa. An array of
lights ring the pilot and co-pilot chairs. Mustang sits to the left, a Blue pilot
to the right. The Blue is jacked into the ship. A blue light glows under the
dermis of her left temple. Mustang flies, right hand in a holographic control
prism, speaking quickly with the Blue. Out the curved viewport, Earth
hovers. Augustus, Pliny, and comically stooped Kavax au Telemanus
discuss our options behind Mustang.
      It is quiet.
      “Well done, Darrow,” Augustus says without looking back to me.
“Though you could have chosen a better ship …”
      Mustang interrupts. “What’s going on back there? They said someone
was hurt.”
      “Quinn is dying,” I say. “We have to get her to a medBay, fastlike.”
      “Even when we hit orbit, we’re thirty minutes out from our fleet,”
Mustang says.
      “Fly faster.”
      The ship trembles as Mustang and the Blue push it hard.
      “It was a good plan,” Kavax says, beaming down at Mustang. “It was a
good plan, Virginia, infiltrating the Sovereign’s household. Just like when
you were a girl. The time you and Pax hid in the shrubbery to listen to your
father’s counsel. Except Pax was bigger than the shrub!” He booms a laugh
that startles the quiet Blue.
      Mustang reaches back to squeeze his forearm, hand smaller than his
elbow. He preens like a hound with a pheasant in its jaws, looking around to
see if we all noticed her compliment. She’s got a way with men bigger than
bears.
      The love on the man’s face makes Augustus’s own disinterest
monstrous. And even worse, thinking about the Jackal killing this man’s son
makes me sick.
      Mustang spares me the slightest glance, her hair bound behind her
head, the memory of a smile still creasing the corners of her lips, and it’s
like I’ve been punched in the heart. There’s no smile for me. And the horse
ring no longer graces her finger.
      There’s silence for a long moment. Augustus turns to look at me. “I
assume Octavia attempted to bring you into her fold as well?”
      “She attempted.”
      “Slag herself. Bet you told her to go slag herself, eh, boy?” Kavax
booms. He slaps my shoulder, knocking me into Victra. “Sorry.” He’s bent
like a hothouse tree grown too tall for its roof. Water drips from his red
forked beard. “Sorry,” he repeats to Victra.
      “Actually, Lord Telemanus, I thought her offer tempting. She manages
to treat her lancers with respect. Unlike others.”
      Augustus wastes no time with banter. “We’ll amend that. I owe you a
debt, Darrow. Provided we make it to my fleet.”
      “You owe it to Mustang and the Howlers as much as me,” I say.
      “What is a Howler?” he asks.
      “My friends in the black armor. Sevro’s the leader.”
      “Sevro. That wretched little thing that was atop my lancer, yes?” The
ArchGovernor raises an eyebrow. “Thought I recognized him. Fitchner’s
boy.” His tone sits poorly with me. “The one that killed that Priam brat in
the Passage.”
      “He’s with us, my liege. Loyal as my own hands.”
      The door hisses open and Sevro and Tactus join us. We all turn to look.
Sevro recoils slightly. “What?” he challenges.
      Tactus scoots off to the side, away from Sevro.
      “Does your loyalty lie with me or with your father, Sevro?” Augustus
asks.
      “What father? I’m a bastard’s bastard.” Sevro looks the ArchGovernor
up and down skeptically. “And all due respect, my liege, I could give a cat’s
frozen piss about you too. Your daughter brought me from the Rim. My
allegiance is to her. But above all it’s to Reaper. That’s it.”
      “Mind your manners, you little puppy,” Kavax growls.
      “You must be Pax’s father. Sorry he went. He’s a man I might have
died for. But I see he got his good looks from his mother.”
      Kavax isn’t sure if he’s been insulted.
      Augustus observes this. “Darrow, I owe you an apology. You were
right. Loyalty, it seems, can extend beyond the Institute. Now … Lysander.”
Augustus glances out the shuttle’s viewports. We rise steadily. He kneels to
speak with the boy. “I’ve heard tell that you are an exceptional lad.”
      “I am, my liege,” Lysander says as firmly as he can. “They test me
regularly, and I train in all manners of studies. I rarely lose in chess. And
when I do, I learn, as I ought.”
      “Do you now? I had a son like you, once, Lysander. But I’m sure you
knew that.”
      “Adrius au Augustus,” Lysander says, knowing the lineage.
      “No.” Augustus shakes his head. “No. My younger son isn’t like you
at all.”
      The boy frowns. “Then the elder. Claudius au Augustus?”
      Mustang glances back.
      “Yes.” Augustus nods. “A kind, special boy with a lion’s heart. Better
than me. Kinder. A ruler.” He spares a strange, meaningful glance at me.
“You would have been friends.”
      Lysander tries to look dignified. “What happened to him?”
      “They left that part out, eh? Well, a large young man from the House
Bellona by the name of Karnus took liberties with a certain young woman
my son was courting. My son took umbrage and challenged Karnus to a
duel. In the end, when my boy was broken and bleeding, Karnus knelt,
cupped my son’s head”—he puts one hand around Lysander’s head—“and
smashed it on the cobbled stones till it broke open and all his specialness
dripped out.” He pats the boy on the cheek. “Let’s hope you never have to
see such a thing.”
      “Is that your plan for me, my liege?” Lysander asks bravely.
      “I’m only a monster when it is practical.” Augustus smiles. “I don’t
think I will have to be this time. You see, we’re just trying to get home. So
long as your mother lets us, as it seems like she is doing, then you will be
safe.”
      “Mother says you’re a liar.”
      “Ironic. You will tell her we’ve treated you well, I hope.”
      “If I am well treated.”
      “Fair enough.” Augustus touches the boy’s shoulder and stands.
“Victra. Take him to the passenger hold.”
      Victra glowers. Of course Augustus chooses the only woman but
Mustang. Tactus notices her reaction and steps forward. “Might I, my liege?
I’ve not seen my own brothers in some time. I wouldn’t mind talking with
the lad.” Augustus nods as if to say he doesn’t care. Victra thanks Tactus,
surprised by his gesture. He winks at her, punches my shoulder, and pats
Lysander roughly on the head, almost knocking him down. I’d hate to know
his brothers.
      “Come, tiny one. Tell me, have you ever been to a Pearl club?” he
asks, leading him away. “The girls and boys there are spectacular …”
      The ponderous stork climbs higher and higher. In two minutes, we’ll
hit atmosphere.
      “They tried to kill me as I slept,” Augustus murmurs. “She knows I
will not forgive this.”
      “She’ll come to Mars,” I say.
      “Is there no chance for amends to be made?” Pliny asks.
      “Amends?” Mustang snarls. “Make amends with the woman who
burned a moon, Pliny? Are you an idiot?”
      “Peace will preserve your line, my liege. More than war. Set yourself
against the Sovereign, and what hope can there be?” Pliny is no fool with
rhetoric. “Her fleets are vast. Her monies endless. Your name, your honor,
no matter how great, cannot stand beneath the weight of the Society. My
liege, you raised me to your side because of my worth. Because you trusted
my advice. Without you, I am nothing. Your care is all I value. So heed my
advice now, if you still hold it in regard, and do not let this wound against
the Sovereign fester. Do not let war come of this. Remember Rhea, yes, and
how it burned. Preserve your honored family with peace, by any means.”
      Augustus raises his voice. “When the Sovereign pushed against me, I
bent like Gold should, with grace, with dignity. But now she cuts at me, and
beneath the grace, beneath the aplomb, her knife will strike iron. We make
for Mars, and for war.”
      “We’re reaching the low atmosphere,” Mustang says. “Hold on.”
      “What is that light?” Sevro asks. “The blinking one over the altimeter.”
      The Blue snaps an answer. “The cargo bay door is opening, dominus.”
      “The cargo bay …” I frown. “Can you override it?”
      “No, dominus. I’m locked out.”
      Why would the cargo bay door be …?
      “He volunteered,” Mustang says, voice panicked. “Tactus
volunteered.”
      “No,” I snarl, startling everyone but Mustang. We realized it at the
same time. “Sevro, Victra, on me!” I wheel around and sprint out the cabin
doors, head ducked as I move fast as I can toward the back of the ship.
      “Prepare for evasive action,” I hear Mustang say back in the cabin.
      “What’s happening?” Pliny whines.
      “TACTUS!” I bellow. Victra and Sevro run at my heels. The other
Howlers and Housemembers call to me, confused as I sprint through the
passenger bay.
      Screwface unbuckles his crashbelt. “He went past with the boy.”
      “Down!” I say, shoving him in his seat. “Everyone stay seated!”
      Tactus wouldn’t. He couldn’t. But why the hell not? Why would I ever
assume he wouldn’t do what’s best for him? It’s in his nature.
      We slide down railings to the storage level, past the room where the
Jackal operates on Quinn. I shove open the door to the cargo hold and am
greeted by the howling of wind. The hatch hangs open to show darkness
wounded by city lights far beneath. Clown and an Augustus lancer lie
unconscious, bleeding. They slide slowly toward the open bay door. As for
Tactus, he’s nothing but a distant dot in the darkness. I cannot see him
clearly, but I know what he has taken. Lysander.
      “Sevro.” I grip my friend’s shoulder. “Stop!” He’s seething. Looks like
he wants to jump out the back of the ship and follow Tactus into the air. He
can’t. It’s too late. Instead, we catch the two unconscious Golds before they
slip down the open ramp. Victra shuts it at the control panel. The door
hisses closed.
      “He doesn’t have any communications gear,” Victra says breathlessly.
“Not after the EMP.”
      “Doesn’t need the gorydamn gear.” Sevro points to Clown’s naked
feet. “The bastard has gravBoots. Soon as he hits the ripWing scanners,
he’ll be picked up.”
      I do the math. “We have two minutes till they send boarding parties.”
20
Helldiver

      I should have known what Tactus would do. He killed his first Primus
in the Institute, Tamara. He only ever followed strength. Only ever sought
victory. I knew he was a beast, but I thought he was my beast. I thought I
could trust him. No, I thought I could change him. I curse myself. Arrogant
fool. I stalk back to the cockpit, where Augustus addresses the Blue pilot.
      “Pilot, will you be able to take us clear?”
      “No, dominus. Geomet models don’t show a probability of escape.”
Her response is fittingly Blue—emotionally distant, efficient, and
declarative. Her body is thin, faintly avian. Like she’s make all of twigs,
neck long, bald head slightly smaller. Eyes large and as uncannily azure as
the digital tattoos of her skull. When she moves, it’s like she’s submerged in
water. Asteroid born, judging by her flat accent.
      “What is the likely scenario?”
      “They will destroy our engines with ripWing fire. Precipitating a hull
breach that will kill all aboard. Alternatively, precipitating a leechCraft
assault. Capturing all aboard.”
      “Or they’ll just blast us from the gory sky,” Sevro adds.
      “Blue, deliver me to my ship and you will receive command of a
frigate,” Augustus offers.
      “I would prefer a cruiser,” she notes.
      “A cruiser then.”
      “Very well.” The Blue adjusts several knobs. “I will fly well, but the
paradigm must be altered before they engage our vessel, if we are to
survive.”
      The stork climbs toward the edge of Luna’s atmosphere. This ship is a
big-bellied beast. Fat with storage room, because all they’re meant to do is
birth soldiers out of the tubes in their guts. Men like me would tear her
apart in our ripWings. We used ships like this at the Academy to launch
men in starShells at enemy asteroid bases.
      Friction fire wreaths the ship.
      “If the hull is breached, hold your breath, dominii,” the pilot instructs.
“We don’t have sufficient survival helmets aboard.”
      Victra frowns. “Our lungs will explode if we do that.”
      “Then exhale,” the Blue replies. “And have thirty secs of life while
eardrums explode and blood vessels swell like inflated balloons. I will hold
my breath.”
      Sevro looks back at me, wide-eyed. “I hate space.”
      “You hate everything.”
      We pop clear of Luna’s atmosphere. The fire fades and we slip into
open space, where the armada’s capital ships glide like behemoths of
Europa’s deep sea. Gun turrets dot their hide like barnacles, and hangar
bays slice their undersides like great gills. Commercial ships float slowly
along the shipping lanes. RipWings and wasps go about their patrols. None
pay heed to our presence except those that escort us from Luna. The
Sovereign would not broadcast this. Time ticks away.
      There is nowhere to flee. We thought to pass just under the guns of the
Scepter Armada when we had Lysander. But now we’ll have to run the
gauntlet.
      Our pilot is calm as metal.
      She said the paradigm must change.
      What can I do? Think. Think.
      “We will open communications to one of the ships,” Augustus says.
“Bribe them into sheltering us. Every man has a price.”
      “We’re jammed. Can’t even broadcast,” Mustang reminds him.
      We’re going to die. We all know it. Augustus doesn’t panic or
surrender resolve. I don’t know how I thought he’d handle death. Maybe I
hoped he would wail about and turn pale. But for all his faults, he is
stalwart. After a moment, he sets a bony hand on Mustang’s shoulder. She
flinches, surprised.
      “Whether missile or boarding craft come, die like Golds,” Augustus
says solemnly to us. Not because he wishes us to think him strong in his last
moments, but because he believes in what he is—a superior being, a master
of his human frailties. For him, death is merely the ultimate frailty. Humans
whimper when they die. They claw for life even if there is no hope. He will
not. Death is not grander than his pride.
      Golds, in many ways, are so like Reds. Helldivers go to their deaths
for their families, for the pride of their clan. They do not whimper when the
mines collapse around them or when the pitvipers come from the shadows.
They fall and their friends weep and sweep their bodies aside. But we have
the Vale to look forward to; what have the Golds? When they perish, their
flesh withers and their name and deeds linger till time sweeps them away.
And that is all. If anyone should claw for life now, it should be the Aureate.
      I claw because I carry the torch of something that must not die, must
not go out. That is why I grab Sevro on the shoulder and, with a horrible,
eerie laugh, tell the pilot to take us closer to the deadliest ship in orbit, one
which now has angled itself to intercept us.
      “Take us near the Vanguard,” I repeat to the Blue.
      “That would cause our chances of survival to decrease by—”
      “Never tell me the odds, just do it,” I command.
      Everyone turns and looks at me. Not because I’ve said something
strange but because they’ve been waiting to turn and look at me. They’ve
all been silently praying I would marshal a plan. Even Augustus.
      Eo said people would always look to me. She believed I had some
quality, some essence that gave hope. I rarely feel it in myself. There is
none in me now. Just dread. Inside I feel such a boy—angry, petulant,
selfish, guilty, sad, alone—and yet they look to me. I almost break
underneath their gaze, almost wither away and ask someone else to take the
reins. I can’t do it. I’m small. I’m just a liar in a carved body. But that
dream must not be extinguished.
      So I act and they watch.
      “You gone space mad?” Victra asks. “When they realize we don’t have
the boy …”
      “Draw an angle toward the Vanguard’s bridge,” Mustang tells the
Blue.
      Augustus gives me a curt nod, guessing what I plan. “Hic sunt
leones.”
      “Hic sunt leones,” I echo, saving my last look for Mustang, not the
man who hanged my wife. She doesn’t notice. I leave the bridge with Sevro
at a dead sprint. Something hits our ship. Her hull shudders. They know we
don’t have Lysander.
      “Howlers! Get up!” I shout.
      Harpy throws up her hands. “I thought you said—”
      “UP!” I roar.
      Red secondary lights bathe the launch bay in bloody hues as Sevro and
I load ourselves into the cold starShells. It takes three Howlers each to help
the two of us slip into the robotic carapaces. I lie in the armor as Harpy
buckles my feet into the stirrups and closes the armored legs over my meat
and bones. The Howlers are fast in their movements even as the ship
lurches with another near missile strike. A siren howls, reporting a hull
breach. I try to slow my breath as Victra fits my head into the starShell’s
helmet.
      “Good luck.” She leans her face close. Before I can stop her, she
presses her lips to mine. I do not recoil, not this close to death. I let her lips
part and cling warm and comforting around mine. Then the human moment
is over, and she’s gone, lowering the massive visor of my helmet. My
Howlers howl and hoot at the sight. I can’t help but wish it was Mustang
who sealed me in this tin can, and kissed me goodbye; but then the digital
display owns my vision and I disappear from my friends into the metal
launch tube. I’m alone. And scared.
      Focus.
      I’m cocooned, belly-down, in the spitTube. This is where most would
piss themselves, separated from friends, from the warmth of life. There’s no
gravity in the tube. It isn’t pressurized. I hate the weightlessness of it.
      I can’t look up or my neck will break when they launch me. I can’t
move side to side. My starShell is latched into a thousand toothlike
magnetic hooks. They click into place like tiny insects, chattering.
      In moments they’ll shoot me into space. My breath rasps. My heart
rattles against my sternum. I drink in my body’s terror and smile. They said
this was suicide at the Academy when I wanted to launch myself. Maybe
they were right.
      But this is why I was made. To dive into hell.
      I’m a beetle of man in a carapace of metal, weapons, and engines that
costs more than most ships. I’ve got a pulseCannon on my right arm. When
I need it, it will bloom like a haemanthus blossom.
      I think of the time Eo laid a haemanthus before my front door, the time
I plucked one from the wall on the night that I was supposed to win the
Laurel. How far away those warm days seem from this cold place, where
petals are metal instead of soft like silk.
      “We’re getting pinned in. Boarding parties imminent,” Mustang’s
voice comes over the com. “Priming your launch.” The ship moans as
another missile almost claims us. Our shields are shot. Just the rickety hull
holding us together.
       “Aim true,” I say.
       “Always. Darrow …” Her silence says a thousand things.
       “I’m sorry,” I tell her.
       “Good luck.”
       “This is not fun,” Sevro groans.
       The ship’s hydraulic system hisses and the metal teeth jerk me forward
in the tube, loading me into the chamber. Inches before my head, the
magnetic stream of the railgun hums dreadfully, daring me to glance its
way.
       They say that many Golds can’t take this, that even Peerless can panic
and scream and cry in the spitTube. I believe it. Pixies would have heart
attacks right now. Some cannot even ride in a spaceship for fear of small
places and the vastness of space. Soft-bellied fools. I was born in a home
smaller than the cargo bay of this ship. I made my life at the end of a
clawDrill that makes this tube look like a child’s toy, all while sweating and
pissing my soul away in a frysuit cobbled together from scrap.
       Still there’s the terror.
       “Watch how a pitviper strikes, my son.” Father once clutched me by
my wrist and made me play this game. “Watch it coil upward and upward
till it reaches its crest. Don’t move before then. Don’t strike out with your
slingBlade. If you do, then it’ll get you. It’ll kill you. Move just when it’s
coming down. Do that with the terror in life. Don’t act till you’re as scared
as you’ll get, then …” He snapped his fingers.
       I’m at that point when the music of the machines takes hold. The
clicks and the clacks, the hisses and the hums reverberate through the hull.
A countdown begins.
       “Ready over there, Goblin?” I ask Sevro over the com.
       “Cacatne ursus in silvis?”
       Does a bear shit in the woods? The ship spins and shudders. More
sirens howl.
       “Latin, now?”
       “Audentes fortuna juvat,” Sevro chuckles.
       “Fortune favors the bold? You deserve to die if that’s really going to be
the last thing you say in this life.”
       “Yes? Well, you may suck my—”
      My heart sticks its downward beat.
      The metal teeth jerk me forward into the tube’s magnetic stream. And
it happens. Even through my suit, g-forces hit me like the backhand of the
Obsidians’ thunder god. My vision flickers black. Stomach rises into throat.
Lungs constrict. Blood slows in my veins. I snap forward. Lights flicker in
my eyes. I don’t see the walls of the tube I’m shot through. I don’t even see
the ship that brought me here. I see Eo’s face in the darkness. I black out.
Bodies can’t take this. Too fast.
      Darkness.
      Then the darkness has holes.
      Stars.
      There’s no meantime. One second I’m on the ship, the next I’m ripping
through the deep of space at fifteen times the speed of sound.
      Many shit their suits at this point. It’s not a fear thing. It’s biology and
physics. The human body can only take so much. Mickey the Carver made
sure mine could take just a little bit more. I hope Sevro can too.
      I rip soundlessly through space. Trust that Sevro is near me. Can’t see
him, even on the sensors. All too fast. Toward the greatest ship in the
Scepter Armada—the one we should avoid. It all happens in six seconds.
Emergency missiles streak past us. The gunners see us now. Know what’s
happening. But we’re not using thrusters, so the missiles can’t lock. Flack
can’t detonate on so short a fuse. The unspent canisters fly past us, nearly
hitting me. Our pilot took a perfect shot.
      Railguns miss us. Projectiles flash past. Sevro is howling in the com.
Their shields are down. They can’t bring them up fast enough. It takes time.
Iridescent blue flickers over their hull as the pulseShields power up. Too
late, you sons of bitches.
      Too bloodydamn late.
      I can’t think. I’m screaming inside. Laughing like the flames of a
wildfire. Laughing because I know it is my madness that these logical
warriors cannot fight.
      The bridge is close. I spare a look up. See Golds inside roaring at each
other. Rushing to their evacsuits or escape pods. Staring at us approach like
Mustang did when my horses of House Mars crashed into her and Pax in a
muddy field. Our rage is something unique. Something these Luneborn
don’t understand.
      Blues scatter. Obsidians pull their weapons. Two Golds don
breathmasks and unfurl razors, readying for the kill. The second before we
hit, I shoot my pulseCannon. It thumps on the thick glass. Shoot again and
again and again. Then I curl into a ball and smash into the thick bridge glass
with the full velocity of my launch as well as a last-second burst from my
thruster boots.
      Out of me roars a madman’s scream.
21
Stains

      I explode through the bridge like a ball of lead shot into a store of
china and glass. I crash into displays and strategy desks before blasting
through the reinforced metal of the bridge walls, through the steel of the
hallways till at last I slam bodily into a bulkhead a hundred meters through
and past the bridge. Dazed. Can’t find Sevro. I call him over the com. He
groans something about his ass. Maybe he did shit himself.
      We can’t hear it because of our helmets, but the ship is filled with
howling as the vacuum of space sucks crewmembers to their deaths. It
really doesn’t suck them out through the shattered windows so much as the
internal pressure of the ship pushes them out. Either way, Blues and
Oranges and Golds fly screaming into space. The Obsidians go silently. Not
that it matters. Space makes all silent in the end.
      My left arm spits sparks. My pulseCannon is shredded. Inside the suit,
my arm hurts like hell. I have a concussion. I puke inside my helmet. Fills it
with a bitter stench, stings the nostrils. But I keep my feet, and my right arm
works well enough. Viewshield is cracked. I stumble as I’m sucked toward
the bridge too.
      I crawl back through the holes I made in the walls. Make it to the
bridge to find the place in chaos. Crewmembers hold to anything to prevent
themselves from being sucked into the cold darkness. A Gold girl flips past
me and flies out the bulkhead. Finally, red lights flash. Emergency
bulkheads slam shut all over this part of the ship to cut the pressure leak.
One begins to close behind me, reinforcing a wall that I crashed through. I
hold it up when I see Sevro coming. The metal groans against the robotic
arm of my starShell. Sevro dives through just in time and the door slams
shut. Bridge is locked down with us inside. Perfect.
      The pressure wind dies behind us as durosteel slats slide over the
demolished viewports. The ship’s officers and crew pick themselves up
from the ground, gasping for breath, but there is none. Oxygen and pressure
are still being pumped back into the room. So those with breathing masks—
the Golds, Obsidians, and Blues—watch placidly as the few Pink valets and
Orange technicians on the bridge flop like fish, gasping for air that is not
there. One Pink vomits blood, his lungs exploding in his chest because he
tried to hold his breath. The Blues watch the deaths in horror. They have
never seen men die. They are used to seeing blips on the scanners
disappearing. Perhaps a distant ship exploding or gouting flame as it is
boarded by Obsidians and Grays. Their understanding of the mortal coil is
being adjusted.
      The Obsidians and Golds don’t react to the scene. Some of the Grays
attempt to administer aid, but it is too late. By the time the pressure and
oxygen levels are normalized, the lowColors are dead. I’ll never forget
those faces. I brought them this. How many families will weep because of
what I did here?
      In anger, I stomp my metal boot on the steel deck. Three times. And
those who did nothing while their allies died turn to see Sevro and me in
our killing suits.
      Oh, how those Gold and Obsidian faces finally emote.
      An Obsidian charges us with a forcePike. Sevro hits him once,
crushing the huge man with a metal fist. The other four link together and
attack us, keening one of their hideous war chants. Sevro meets them,
delighted to finally be the biggest in the room. I engage a squad of Grays
who scramble for their weapons.
      This is the way it goes. We’re men of metal fighting disorganized men
of flesh. Like steel fists punching the inside of a watermelon. I’ve never
killed men with so little regard. And it frightens me how easy I find it in
war. There is no ambiguity here, no violation of moral creed. These people
are warColors. They kill me or I kill them. It’s simpler than the Passage.
Simpler that I don’t know them, that I don’t know their brothers and sisters,
that I use metal instead of my own flesh to drive them through death’s dark
door.
      I am good at it, better by worlds than Sevro, and that terrifies me
above all else.
      I truly am the Reaper. Whatever doubts I had in myself fall away and I
feel the stain creeping over my soul.
      We do our best to save the Blues. The bridge is large, but there aren’t
many Obsidians or Grays with projectile and energy weapons. No reason
for them here; no one has ever come through the viewports. Two female
Golds with razors are the true menace. One is tall and broad. The other has
a quick face that is pinched with desperation as she charges us. With their
razors, they could cut even our suits in half, so Sevro blasts them from a
distance with his pulseCannon, overloading their aegises and splashing the
energy onto armor where it overloads the pulseShields and eats into the
armor, melting the Golds. This is why they control technology. Humans, no
matter their Color, are fragile as doves in the meat grinder of war.
      My enemies dead, I turn now to the Blues in the pits. “Is there a
captain?” I ask.
      In my suit, I stand nearly a meter taller than them. They’re still staring
at the mess we made of the others. I must be a walking nightmare. Arm
spitting sparks. Suit half ruined. Holding a terrible razor.
      “I don’t have all day to threaten and stomp. You are erudite men and
women. This is not your ship. You merely occupy it for the Gold who
commands it. I now command it. So. Is there a Blue captain about?”
      The captain survived. He’s a placid, clean-looking man, more limbs
than torso, with a fresh gash on his face that pains him terribly. He trembles
and sniffles, holding the wound as though his face would fall apart were his
hands to leave it. Uncle Narol would have called him a shiteating
ninnypriss. Eo would taken a different tact, so I stand over him and speak
quietly.
      “You are safe,” I say. “Do not attempt anything rash.”
      I pop my helmet. The sick drips out. I tell him he’s to go to the corner
and strip off his star badge of rank. Trembling, he doesn’t get a chance to
obey. Sevro lurches forward, takes his badge, and picks him up and moves
him like a doll.
      A plump dark-skinned woman more shoulders than anything else
snorts at the demotion. She’s peculiarly substantial for a Blue. Bald, like the
rest, with digital azure tattoos swirling not only along crown and temples,
but over hands and neck.
      Sevro lopes back to me.
      “Sevro, stop pissing around.”
      “I like being big.”
      “I’m still bigger.”
      He tries flipping me the crux in his suit, but the mechanical fingers
aren’t so agile.
      I give orders to the Blues in the tech pits that our friends in the stork
are to be given access to one of the hangar bays. After settling themselves
back into their stations, they obey. All here are loyal, because I have them
under my power. But throughout the ship, who knows? They may be loyal
to the Sovereign. Or they may only be loyal to the man who rules this ship.
It’d be foolish to think they all operate under the same creed. I’ll have to
make them.
       I watch the stork coast into a hangar bay on a display. She’s barely
held together by her bolts. Two leechCraft festoon her. My Howlers will
have to fight off the squads of killers they contained. They might manage,
but if the Vanguard’s Obsidians and Grays besiege them in the hangar, then
all is lost.
       Sounds come now from the bulkhead that connects the bridge with the
rest of the ship. A deepspine hissing. The door glows red from heat, a small
pupil in the center of the thick gray durosteel. Obsidians or Gray marines,
no doubt led by some Gold, endeavor to reclaim the ship. Should take them
a little while.
       “Is there a holoCam in the hall?” I ask the Blues.
       They hesitate. “Blackspace, you daft gasbags,” curses the female Blue
I noted before. She pushes another Blue out of the way and syncs her
tattoos with the console. A holo appears on one of the screens, confirming
my fear. Golds lead the party attempting to make their way onto the bridge.
       “Show me the engine room, the life support nexuses, and the hangar
bay,” I demand. She does. Again, Golds lead parties of Gray marines and
Obsidian slave-knights to secure the ship’s vital systems. They’ll try to
wrest control of it away from me. Worse, they’ll try to board or destroy the
stork to kill or capture Mustang and my friends.
       “Who wants this ship?” I ask severely. I stalk along the raised
command podium, kicking aside a body in my way, and look down at the
communications Blues in their pit. They dodge my gaze, two women no
older than I. Faces pale and fresh, like morning snow, now stained with tear
tracks and grime. Wide cerulean eyes raw-rimmed and shot with red.
They’ve seen friends die today, and here I rage selfishly, acting as though
this is my triumph. It’s so easy to lose myself.
       Never forget what I am, I remind myself. Never forget.
       We’re being hailed by a dozen ships and the Citadel ground command.
What’s happened, they want to know. TorchShips and destroyers coast
warily toward us. I open a closed-circuit com channel to the whole of my
ship.
      “Attention, crew of the vessel formerly known as the Vanguard,
hereafter known as the Pax.” I pause dramatically, knowing that any good
song, any good dance, is a game of tension leading to a climax of sound and
movement.
      Sevro can’t stop grinning boyishly at me. He looks like an imp in the
huge suit, head so small with his helmet off. He makes a big motion with
his hands to try and make me laugh. I shake my head at him. Now isn’t the
time.
      “My name is Darrow au Andromedus, lancer of the Martian House
Augustus, and I have claimed this vessel as a spoil of war. It is mine. This
means, per Societal rules of naval warfare, that your lives are mine. I am
sorry for that, because it means you will likely all die.
      “Your lives have been dedicated to one vocation or another—electrics,
astral navigation, gunnery, janitorial service, lighting and repair, martial
combat. My vocation is conquest. They teach us it in schools. And in
school, they instructed me on the proper method of invading, seizing, and
possessing an enemy warship. After one has captured the bridge of an
enemy-held vessel, the procedure taught to us is simple: vent the ship.”
      Sevro activates the hidden console secured in the back side of a
navigation display, one only Golds can access. The Blues recoil in surprise.
It is like going into a man’s kitchen and showing him a nuclear bomb
hidden under his sink. The console scans Sevro’s golden Sigil and blinks
gold. All he need do is push in a code, and the entire ship will open to
space. Twenty thousand men and women will die.
      “We made these ships so we could empty them. Why? Not because we
distrust your loyalty—in fact we rely on that—but because there are still
…” I look at the roster one of the Blues gives me. “… sixty-one Golds on
board. They are loyal to the Sovereign. I am her enemy. They will not obey
me. They will sabotage the ship, attempt to take the bridge; they will rally
you, abuse your loyalty, and lead you to certain death. Because of them and
their hatred of me, you will never see your loved ones again.
      “There is yet another complication. Beyond this hull, the Sovereign
wonders what happened here. Soon she will realize the pride of her armada
no longer belongs to her. It is mine. Her Praetors’ ships will vomit out
squadrons of leechCraft carrying legions of Obsidians and Gray marines.
They will be led by Gold knights who want my head, fully prepared to kill
all in their path.
      “If I vent you into space, there will be no one to stop them from killing
me. So you see, you are my salvation, and I am yours. I will not sacrifice
twenty thousand of you to kill sixty-one of my enemies. I chose this vessel
above all others because of its crew. The best the Society can offer. To me
you are not expendable. So what I ask of you is this, choose me as your
commander and overwhelm those Golds who think you expendable.
      “You have my permission, my warrant and the badge of the
ArchGovernor of Mars, Nero au Augustus, to capture or kill your Gold
commanders for me. Take their weapons and subdue them, then make fast
the ship against the invaders who come to destroy us. Do it now. If you
wait, they will kill you! I will know the first men and women to rise up. As
your new master, I will reward you. The ArchGovernor will reward you. Do
it now! For I have just opened every armory throughout the ship. Seize
weapons, and neutralize the tyrants.”
      A heavy silence as the first sparks of revolution are struck.
      Sevro comes close. “That was rousing.”
      “Too demokratic?” I whisper.
      “I don’t think autocratic demokracy counts.” Sevro wrinkles his nose.
“You did threaten to vent them into space.”
      “Threaten? I thought I implied it rather smoothly.”
      “Smooth as gravel, dipshit.” Sevro cackles a bit too enthusiastically
and slaps his leg with his mech hand, denting the metal there. He winces,
then looks up at me, slightly embarrassed. “Slag off.”
      The door behind us begins to hiss. I turn to look at the glowing
bulkhead. My enemies have brought a drill to assail me. My hands shake
from the adrenaline. I feel the weight of dozens of blue eyes. The red of the
door deepens, spreading. We haven’t long.
      My razor ripples into killing form, long and terrible. “Company soon,”
I say. I glance at Sevro, who has been distracted by one of the holo screens.
I order the Blues to take shelter.
      “They’re doing it,” Sevro murmurs. “Goryhell. Darrow, come look.”
      He cycles through live visuals of Oranges and Blues ransacking the
armories. Some Grays help them. Others stand by, unsure of their
prerogative even as others shoot at the tide of their fellow shipmates. But no
bullets can hold back this tide. They take weapons, run sloppily through
halls, swelling their ranks. The roughest lead—not Blues, but Orange
hangar workers and mechanics, along with Grays … one I recognize. The
middle-aged corporal on my ship at the Academy, the one who escaped
with us. He directs a score of men and women into the stateroom of a Gold.
They subdue him respectfully. That peaceful accord is not far spread.
     Three powerful squads of Golds, leading Obsidians and Grays,
marshal in the life support rooms, at the engines five kilometers back to the
aft of the ship, and just outside the bridge door. Those outside the bridge
door number four Golds and six Obsidians. Ten Grays load weapons behind
them.
     “We’re still going to have company,” I say.
     They’ll be coming through the door at any moment. Sparks spit from
the inside of the bulkhead as their heat drill gets the better of the door.
Metal drips inward, bubbling to the floor. The Blues shiver in terror, and
Sevro and I square ourselves up and don our helmets, preparing for the new
onslaught. Again the stench of my sick fills my nostrils. I tell the Blues to
hide in the communications bay. They’ll be safe there.
     A com light suddenly blinks on a console near me. Instinctively, I
answer. A voice like thunder sends shivers through my bones. There is no
visual.
     “Can you hear me?”
     “I can.” I glance over at Sevro. Whoever calls us is using a voice
amplifier that sounds like the breaking of thunder. Sevro shrugs as if he
hasn’t a clue who it is. “Who is this?”
     “Are you a god?”
     A god? An eerie quiet settles in me. That is no voice amplifier. I
should have known by the cold, sluggish accent. I choose my words
carefully, remembering my lore. “I am Darrow au Andromedus of the
Sunborn.”
     “You took the vessel and you are not yet Praetor? How?”
     “I flew in through the bridge.”
     “Alone from the Abyss?”
     “With a companion.”
     “I will come to meet you and your companion, godchild.”
     The Blues look to each other in terror. They mouth something. Stained.
The heaviness of fear settles on my shoulders. Sevro and I peer around the
bridge, as though the beast were hiding somewhere in the shadows. More of
the door peels away, dripping inward like some glowing red, rotting fruit.
      Then one of the Blues gasps and we glance back at the HC monitor to
see the cameras in the halls outside the bridge door relaying a scene of
horror. It—he—runs at them from behind as they prepare to make entry into
the bridge—an Obsidian, but larger than any I’ve ever seen. But it’s not just
his size. It’s how he moves. A dread creature stitched from shadow and
muscle and armor. Flowing, not running. Perverse. Like looking at a blade
or a weapon made flesh. This is a creature that dogs would flee. That cats
would hiss at. One that should never exist on any level above the first tier of
hell.
      He smashes into the kill squad from behind with two pulsing white
ionBlades that extend out of his armor three feet from his hands. The Grays
he simply runs through, crushing them into the walls with his shoulders,
splintering their bones. Then he starts the real killing. It’s so savage I have
to look away.
      The heat drill continues melting the door of its own accord. And in its
center forms a hole. Through it I can see men and women dying. Blood
sizzles on the overheated metal.
      When the Stained is done, he’s bleeding from a dozen wounds, and
there’s only one Gold left. She stabs him with a razor, piercing his dark
armor through the breastplate. He twists his body, locking the blade in, and
then clutching it when she lets the blade relax back into a whip. Then he
grabs her by her helmet, her golden armor glittering under the hall’s lights.
She tries to escape, tries to scramble away, but like a lion with a hyena in its
jaws, he need simply squeeze. When she is gone, he lays her gently on the
ground, tender now that he’s brought her a good death. Sevro involuntarily
steps back from the door.
      “Mothermercy …”
      The Stained stands on the other side, the door between us slowly
melting from the center. When the hole in the door is the size of a torso, he
removes his helmet. A hairless, pale face stares as me. Eyes black. Wind-
weathered cheeks armored with calluses like the hide of a rhinocerous.
Head bald except a meter-long white shock of hair that hangs to his mid-
back.
      We lock eyes and he addresses me.
      “Godchild Andromedus, I am Ragnar Volarus, the Stained firstborn of
my mother, Alia Snowsparrow of the Valkyrie Spires north of the Dragon’s
Spine, south of the Fallen City, where the Winged Horror flies, brother of
Sefi the Quiet, breaker of Tanos, which once stood by the water, and I make
you an offering of stains.”
     He splays out his gigantic bloodstained hands and then reaches
through the door with his right hand. His ionBlades retract into his armor.
The razor still juts out of his ribs.
     I’m pissing my bloodydamn suit.
     “Well, frag me blind,” Sevro mutters. “Do it, Darrow. Before it
changes its mind.”
     Taking my helmet off, I step forward. I want this one.
     “Ragnar Volarus. Well met. I see you wear no badge. Do you have a
master?”
     “I bore the mark of the Ash Lord, and was to be presented as a gift
with this great vessel to the Family Julii. But you took this vessel, and so
you have taken me.”
     The Julii? A gift for their betrayal of Augustus, no doubt.
     And did he just use a bureaucratic loophole to justify killing his
master’s men? If there’s irony in his voice, I can’t find it. But why would he
do that? Do those black eyes of his know me? Stained cannot use tech other
than military materiel. He could never have seen me before, yet his hand
remains, waiting to grip mine.
     “Why do you do this?” I ask. “Is it the Julii?”
     “They trade my kind.” I had forgotten. It is Julii ships that carry
Obsidian slaves across the abyss. They know to fear the speared sun of
Victra’s family crest.
     He not practiced at hiding his hate. It is cold as the ice the man was
born into.
     “Will you accept these stains, godchild?” he asks, leaning forward,
voice plaintive, a strange worry creasing the corners of his mouth. Golds
did this after the Dark Rebellion, the only uprising to ever threaten their
reign. We took their history, took their technology, wiped out a generation,
and gave their race the poles of planets, the religion of the Norse, and told
them we were their gods. A few hundred years later, I stand looking up at
one of their most terrifying sons, and wonder how he can think of me as a
god.
     “I accept these stains in my name, Ragnar Volarus.” Terrified, I reach
forward and, with superheated metal surrounding our arms, clasp hands,
nearly equal in size, though mine is sheathed in metal. I take the blood that
his hand spreads to mine and wipe it over my exposed brow. “I accept their
burden and their weight.”
     “Thank you, Sunborn. Thank you. I will serve on the honor of my
mother and her mother before her.”
     “I have friends aboard the stork in hangar bay three. Save them,
Ragnar, and I will owe you a debt.”
     Yellow teeth are revealed as he smiles, and from him undulates a war
chant deeper than the ocean at storm. It fills the halls with dread. Fills me
with joy and fear and primal curiosity. What did I just gain?
22
Fire Blossom

      My body trembles in the aftermath of the giant’s departure. Steadying
myself, I turn back to the Blues, who stand transfixed, unsure of whether to
look to me or the HC displays or the scanners that show the Sovereign’s
men-of-war encircling us. “You have nothing to fear here,” I say. “The
captain of this ship was demoted because he left his viewports open.
Foolishly. Rank does not excuse mistakes. I wish for a new captain. We
haven’t much time. So I will decide in sixty seconds.”
      The dark-skinned Blue comes forward past her fellows. At first, I
thought the tattoos on her hands featured floral lines. Then I note a stream
of mathematical notations: the Larmor formula. Maxwell’s equations in
curved-space time. Wheeler-Feynman absorber theory. And a hundred
others that even I don’t recognize.
      “Give me the badge and I’ll carve you a hole back to Mars, boy.” Her
voice has no inflection. It is flat. Precise and lazy all at once. Emotion bled
out of it till only the letters and sounds of the words remain like equations
in the air. “I swear it on my life.”
      “‘Boy’?” I ask.
      “You’re half my age. Shall I call you ‘lord boy’? Or will you be
offended?”
      Sevro raises an eyebrow, flummoxed at the Blue’s bland audacity.
      “Forgive her, dominus,” another Blue says smoothly. “She is an ensign
with—”
      I hold up a hand. “What’s your name, Blue?”
      “Orion.”
      “That’s a boy’s name,” Sevro says.
      “Is it? I hadn’t noticed.” Blues can be sarcastic? “My Sect intended for
me to be a man. I surprised them.”
      “What Sect?” Sevro asks.
      “She has no Sect. She was appropriated by the Copernican Sect, but
dismissed shortly thereafter, for obvious reasons,” that officious Blue
interrupts again. “She’s a Docker.”
      Orion flinches. She swivels on the other Blue. Her voice does not rise.
“And what are you but a pedantic little gasp of a fart, Pelus? Hm?”
      “You see,” Pelus explains placidly, “she is a Docker. Emotional
metrics are unmanageable. Not her fault. She is a product of her greasy
environment.”
      “Bolly that,” she says, stepping forward quickly.
      She punches Pelus in the face. He wails, falling backward like he’s
never been hit before. Likely because he hasn’t. Why would a Blue hit
another Blue? They’re test takers, math makers, star charters. But not
fighters.
      “I like the rude one,” Sevro observes.
      “Wait, dominus! I desire the ship!” Another Blue slides forward,
staring at Pelus on the ground. “I … I deserve it? Orion is no more than a
… a … laggard! Her mastery of astrophysics leaves much to be desired, to
say little of her understanding of extraplanetary mass kinetics. She didn’t
even attend the Observatory.”
      Another Blue pushes forward.
      “Forget Arnus! He’s a dodderhead at astrophysics and his assumptions
in theoretical calculus are imprudent at best! I was second in command of
this vessel for six months under the Ash Lord. I served upon it while it was
in its dry berth. Logic supports the maneuver to place me as your captain,
dominus.”
      The armada’s ships continue to hail us over the coms. Men-of-war
slide closer. Inside their bellies, brave men and women will be donning
suits of armor; they’ll board leechCraft and shoot into space to land on my
hull, burrow their way through, praying that they will make it home to have
a meal made by their mother, their spouse. All that while my Blues shove
and push to lead my ship, howling insults at one another’s math skills and
academic integrity.
      “Don’t listen to either of them, dominus!” shouts a woman in that slow
accent. She falls to her knees. “My name is Virga xe Aquarius. I have
studied the physics of astral drift in the Midnight School—far superior to
the Observatory. I hold, amongst others, a doctorate on dark matter and
gravitational lensing. Let me guide your vessel, dominus. To decide in favor
of another would be specious and worse: illogical!”
      These Blues should have used their logic and seen that I look only at
the woman who does not kneel like the rest of them. Orion, the first to
speak, still stands, shoulders square, body squat, pale eyes gleaming. Her
dialect is lowborn, sharper and more worldly than the dreamy lingo of these
academics. Likely from the docks of Phobos or the String Docks near the
Academy’s Can. If she really is a Docker who didn’t go to the Observatory
or the Midnight School, I wonder about the story of how she came to be on
the bridge in the first place.
     “What about all that noise?” I ask Orion, gesturing to the Blues.
     “They’re full of batshit,” she grunts, and jams a thick thumb into her
chest. “I am not full of batshit.” She smiles and nods to the displays where
the other torchShips creep closer. “And you’re running out of time.” I
glance to the scanner stations where alerts signal the secretive launch of two
leechCraft from the Sovereign’s nearby men-of-war and cruisers. “I know I
can do this, otherwise I would not have spoken out. Give me a chance.”
     I nod to Sevro and he tosses her the captain’s winged star.
     “Get us to our fleet.”
     “Rules of engagement?” she asks me.
     “Minimal casualties,” I say. We are good. The Sovereign is the tyrant.
That is how this must play.
     “Aye, dominus.”
     I watch with Sevro as Orion takes command of my ship and sets orders
to rendezvous with Augustus’s ships beyond the Rubicon Beacons. The
squabbling stops as soon as I appoint Orion. They know their chance has
passed, so they slip into their comfortable roles as though they wished
they’d never left them. Their blue Sigils look like tridents against their
forearms in this dimmed lighting.
     There’s a curious remoteness to Blues. An island people in the abyss of
space, they were designed to survive the long journeys from Luna without
mutiny. So they share. They share the same oxygen, the same food, the
same bunks, the same routines, the same pits, the same commanders, the
same lovers, the same Sects, the same ambitions—to do their job with
precision and rise high through merit so that they might honor their Sect.
     I open a com channel to the rest of the fleet and the satellites of Luna.
They can’t stop the signal. Not of this ship. Our arrays are as sophisticated
as any in the Sovereign’s navy.
     “Sons and daughters of Society. This is Darrow au Andromedus of the
House Augustus. I bring terrible tidings. Tonight, your Sovereign has
broken the Compact of our Society. As my master, ArchGovernor Nero au
Augustus, slept under her protection, she made attempt upon his life, the
lives of his family, and those of his Praetors and aides. Along with the
Bellona, she attempted the illegal and immoral murder of more than thirty
Peerless Scarred. She failed.
      “In retaliation, I have taken one of her flagships. And I am now
besieged, with my life, as well as those of my master and his family, at risk.
If we do not fight back, we will die. If we surrender, we will die. I have not
vented the ship. Those aboard have seen the merit of my cause and have
allied themselves with a family that would resist the power-hungry tyrant
Octavia au Lune.”
      Close enough to the truth.
      “Hours ago, our Sovereign told me to betray my house. To betray my
vows. Like her father before her, she is drunk on power and now believes
herself Empress. She told us to bow, witness now our reply.”
      I turn the com off.
      “Mr. Pelus, as you will,” Orion declares. “Let the bastards have it
when they come.” She activates her own tattoos and sinks into digital speak
with the rest of the crew.
      The bridge is silent. A second ticks by, another. On the HC, I watch
three Grays shoot a Gold in the head. In the hangars, Oranges huddle to the
side as Golds lead warColors against the downed stork. Then Ragnar
arrives in the hangar, and the Oranges rally around him, as do armed Reds,
who’ve followed him from the halls. Many die. Something furious grips
these Colors. And though they die, I feel the flickering of rebellion as I give
them permission to do what they’ve wanted to do their entire lives. It’s
there, even if you never see it till the end—that spark of individuality, of
freedom. The door of the stork pops open and Mustang charges out with my
Howlers to aid the lowColors and Ragnar, though even the Telemanuses
keep their distance from the monstrous man
      Beyond my vessel, the enemy ships finally show their menace. The
scanners swell with red. Enemies, leechCraft freshly spilt from the bellies
of the armada around us, streak through space to find our hull. They aim to
take us by storm.
      Orion opens broadsides.
      “It’s so beautiful,” Sevro murmurs. I stand in silence. Railgun payloads
slam through leechCraft, sheering away metal and men, only to carry on
and smash into the hulls and shields of the same men-of-war that launched
the leechCraft.
      My newly appointed captain paces the command plank, arms crossed.
My five-kilometer war vessel begins a roll, cycling through her banks of
railguns as they hurl death into the face of the Sovereign’s fleet. Orion half
turns to face me, smirking for all to see.
      “Now, about carving that path, dominus.”
      And orders the engines to pound blackmatter. We shoot forward
through the remains of two men-of-war.
      My bridge is silent but for the buzz of technical orders. Missiles flash
in concert beyond our hull. We deploy our flak screens, as the enemy has
now deployed theirs, rendering missiles worthless. An aura of light
surrounds us like a no-man’s-land. Railgun ordnance smashes into our hull,
though we do not feel the reverberations here on the bridge. Our equipment
does not spark. Wiring does not fall from overhead compartments. This ship
is the pinnacle of seven hundred years of design.
      Sevro nudges me. “We might just gorywell make it.”
      The armada around us is massive. Beyond massive. It was brought
here to make the gathered lords and all their fleets out past the Rubicon
Beacons tremble, and still it is not half the combined fleet. But now that
very armada quakes from the inside like a corpulent body as some alien
chews its way out of the host.
      We make our escape from the armada in quick fashion.
      They do not pursue us past the Rubicon Beacons, where we are joined
by our small fleet as well as those of the Cordovan, the Telemanuses, the
Norvo. I hope more will flock to our banners after today’s last surprise.
      I examine our wake—naval detritus. Bodies of men and women float
behind my vessel. They came out of cracked and punctured ships. Some are
still alive but will soon freeze or suffocate. More dead in my path. How
many will it take?
      I leave Orion the bridge. Sevro and I find our way to the engineering
bay, where we have Oranges cut us out of our mangled suits. We rush from
there to the hangar, a vast metal depot scattered with ships, equipment, and
now broken men. Yellows dart about aiding the wounded and carting them
off to the sickbay, Grays and Oranges helping carry.
      Weed prods several unarmed Golds with his razor. Pebble and Harpy
help the Yellows. My eyes search frantically for her. I find her under one of
the battered stork’s wings, speaking with her father. A long wound mangles
her left arm. I don’t mention it. They were boarded by a leechCraft, and
managed to sheave the other off when entering the hangar.
      “We’ve put the bulk of the Sovereign’s fleet behind us,” I tell
Augustus.
      “Where is Quinn?” Sevro asks sharply. “Did they get her to the
medBay yet?”
      Mustang does not answer. Instead, she looks to the ramp of the stork,
where Roque descends, carrying Quinn in his arms. She’s pale. Long. And
lifeless. Sevro does not move. Does not speak. His nostrils flare as a breath
catches in his chest, a pitiful sob locked tight in the boy who never cries. He
goes numb. Ghostlike. And I reach for him, but he pulls away not in anger,
but in confusion, as though he was told the future once, and this reality is
not what was promised. He stumbles backward, away from her body,
looking around, before turning and fleeing the hangar.
      Roque walks past me with Quinn. His face is slack and tired. He wants
to say something bitter, but he bites his tongue and just shakes his head at
me. He still does not know why I attacked him in his room before the gala.
And now this. I’ve never seen him so broken.
      “Look at her,” he tells me. “Darrow, look at your friend.”
      I look at Quinn and feel everything go quiet. Here she is, peaceful in
death. Why can we not breathe life back into her? Why can we not simply
restart the day? Do everything right. Save the ones we love.
      Roque moves away with Quinn toward the hangar’s transparent pulse
field, which opens into space. He’s bent and broken as he walks to the stars
to push his lost girl out amongst them.
      I grab the Jackal when I see him exit the stork, demanding to know
what happened. She died, he tells me. It’s just that. He’s tired like the rest of
us. He rolls down his sleeves. “I won’t apologize. I did my best.”
      “Of course you did,” I say, shaking myself. “Of course.”
      He asks me where my helmet cam is. I stare at him. “The footage,” he
says. “Do you even understand what you just did?” He waves around. “Two
men took one of the greatest vessels ever built. Golds will flock to our
banners. All it takes is my media and your story.”
      I tell him, absently, almost forgetting the dataRecorder the Sons of
Ares put in my tooth to record the bomb blast. It’s activated with a clench
of my molars. I clenched them as soon as I sat down in the Sovereign’s
office. I reach inside my mouth and delicately pry it loose of the gums. It is
smaller than a hair. The Jackal’s eyes light up.
      “Where did you get this?” he asks.
      “Black market,” I say. “Sovereign has damned herself. Use the
recording. Make this war a fair fight.”
      I leave the Jackal there and am about to leave the cleanup to others,
when I notice the Oranges and lowColors watching me. I can’t simply lead
with violence. So I join Pebble and Harpy and lend my aid in helping the
wounded to the sickbay. The rest of the Howlers help too. And Mustang,
and eventually even Victra.
      After the last Gray is loaded on a gurney, I stand in the empty hangar.
Augustus has gone to the bridge. The Jackal avoids the Telemanuses who
accompany him, and instead makes for the communications hub. I’m left
alone. Roque is gone. I don’t know what to do, where to go.
      Blood and scorch marks stain the deck. I look at my hands. These are
the consequences of my actions, and I feel so alone. I lean my head against
the cold metal wall.
      She comes from behind. I don’t think she says my name. I’m not sure.
I just smell her damp hair as her arms wrap around me. Squeezing me
tightly.
      “I know you’re tired,” Mustang says quietly. “But Sevro needs you.”
      “What about Roque?” I ask, turning to face her. So much lingers
unsaid between us. So many questions unanswered. So many crimes left
unforgiven. So much anger and perhaps still the faint flicker of something
more. I feel it as she cups my neck, and lets the strength in her fingers lend
itself to me.
      “Not now,” she says. He blames me. And he should. They all should
blame me. And it’s only going to get worse.
23
Trust

       I find him in a communal washroom. He’s earned one of the
staterooms that the others are claiming for the return voyage to Mars, but
that’s not how he thinks. This is still the boy who hid in the horse. No, I
think. Not a boy any longer.
       “She cared for you, Sevro.”
       His arms cross before him, freckled and thin. A towel wraps around
his waist, another hangs around his shoulders. Golds don’t care about
nudity but Sevro always has. He’s gained a tattoo since last I saw him. A
huge black and gray wolf along his back. The Howlers are his everything.
Once they were just a tool to me; now I think of them as something more.
But what does that mean, when I use them just the same? He stares at the
water running into the drain of the shower. Down and down it spirals.
       “In the end, I believe I’ll enjoy war,” he says. “Gotta toughen my spine
a bit. Callous my hands. Bastards tell us it’s all roses and glory.” He looks
up. “Don’t you smell the roses, Reaper?”
       I sit beside him on the bench. “Did you hear what I said?”
       “Course I gory heard you. I’m missing an eye, not an ear.” He taps his
bionic eye with a bony finger. “Course I know she cared. But never in the
way I wanted. She deserved to live. If any of us ugly little shiteaters deserve
it, it was her. There wasn’t a cruel bone in her body. Not one. But it didn’t
matter. It doesn’t matter if we’re good or we’re evil. It’s all up to chance.”
       “It was chance you knew her at all,” I say. “Chance that brought her to
House Mars.”
       “No. It was my father,” Sevro says. “He drafted her, traded a pick with
Juno to get her.” He shakes his head. “All because he thought she would
temper us, govern our anger. If he hadn’t picked her, we wouldn’t have met
her, and she’d be alive.”
       “Maybe,” I say, thinking of Eo. “But she chose to come here. She
chose to follow me. To follow you.”
       “Just like Pax.”
       I nod, touching my pegasus.
     “It’s all piss and shit. Isn’t it?” Sevro says. “Doesn’t matter how pretty
they dress it up. We’re still in the game. We’re always going to be in a
slagging game. Spit on their empire. Spit on this piss and this shit. I came
for you because he told me what you are.”
     I stare at him, unable to understand.
     “What do you mean?” I ask with a nervous laugh.
     “Turn it on,” he says. “I know you brought one. You’re thorough,
Reaper. Always thorough.”
     “Why are you acting so—”
     “Shut up and turn it on.”
     I nod and activate the device in my pocket. A jamField deploys. I’m
not so prideful as the Sovereign to believe no one could listen in. Sevro
stares as me till I shift uncomfortably.
     “So what am I?” I ask.
     “Even now?” he asks, shaking his head. “You are wound tight. Say the
name of the person who sent me.”
     “Mustang sent you. You told me she brought you in from the Rim.
Same with all the Howlers.”
     “That’s right. She did. Took six months to get from Pluto. But guess
who came to me during my layover in Triton. Go on, Reap. Guess.”
     “Lorn?” His lips curl into a sneer. “Fitchner?”
     Sevro spits in my face, right under the eye. “Guess wrong again and I
leave you like this.” He snaps his fingers. “I will not come back. I will not
help you. I will not bleed for you. I will not sacrifice my friends for a man
who doesn’t give enough of a shit about me to put his neck out just once.
Trust goes both ways, Darrow. This time you have to take a leap.”
     He’s not bluffing. And I know what I want to say. But how can it be?
Sevro is a Gold. A bloodydamn Gold. He heard me say “bloodydamn” to
Apollo. He covered it up. Didn’t he? Or was that a mistake? Is he trapping
me? No. No, if that’s true, then the game is already over. Eo’s dream has
failed. Who is closer to me than he? Who loves me more than this strange,
nasty outcast? No one.
     So I look him in his dull gold eyes. “Ares sent you.”
     Silence between us.
     A terrible five seconds. Six. Seven. He stands and locks the door
before pulling a small black crystal from the pocket of his crumpled pants.
“For your breath only.”
      “A whisperGem …”
      I take it tenderly, knowing how much it costs, and blow against its
surface. My breath makes it wobble, then shatter. Small motes of black rise,
drifting up like fireflies out of the grass as dusk settles in deep summer.
They coalesce. Floating and forming a rough holo that hovers between
Sevro and me. The spiked helmet of Ares.
      “My son,” he warbles. “I am sorry. Harmony has betrayed you. She
has betrayed me and initiated a campaign against our principles. I
discovered her intended use of you too late. But you were wise. This is why I
chose you. Steps are being taken to curb her efforts. Continue with your
own. Set Augustus against Bellona and fracture the Pax Solaris.”
      I try to ask it a question, but it is a recording.
      “I realize this must be difficult. I have asked too much of you already.
But you must carry on. Sow chaos. Weaken them. You have much reason to
doubt me. We have not contacted you until now, because you were watched
by Pliny, by the Jackal, and the Sovereign’s spies. Troublemakers breed
interest. But I have watched you too, and I am proud. I know Eo would be
as well. In case you doubt the veracity of this message, a friend would like
to say hello.”
      Ares’s helmet fades and Dancer smiles at me. “Darrow, I want you to
know, we’re with you. Your family is alive and well. The end is coming, my
friend. Soon you’ll be with us. Till then, trust the man Ares sent; I recruited
him myself. Break the chains.”
      The image erodes, blackish light decaying into the air. And I’m left
staring at the shower floor.
      “You look good for all that surgery,” Sevro says. His smile is no less
nasty than usual. “Ares sent that cripple to me. The one who sent you to the
Institute. Dancer.”
      He can’t say any more because I’m hugging him and crying. I sob and
hold on to him, shaking, scaring him. He doesn’t move except to pat me on
the head. All the weight falls from my shoulders. Someone knows. He
knows and he’s here. He knows and he came to help me. To help me. I can’t
stop shaking and saying thank you. Eo was right. I was right. “You are my
friend,” I tremble out like a child. It almost makes him cry seeing me this
way.
      A true friend.
       “Of course,” he says haltingly. “But only if you stop blubbering, man.
We’re still Golds.”
       I pull back from him, embarrassed, wiping my face on my sleeve. I
think I mumble an apology. My vision’s bleary. I sniff. He hands me a
towel, which I blow my running nose into. He makes a face.
       “What?”
       “That was for your eyes.”
       We laugh together and then sit in an awkward silence. In time, I ask
him how long he’s known. He suspected something since the Institute, he
says, where he heard me say “bloodydamn” to Apollo. My voice went all
thick, all rusty. Then Dancer showed him the video of my carving.
       “Somehow they knew you could trust me, even if you didn’t, shithead.
Always been that way. Always will be that way.”
       “It doesn’t … bother you?” I ask him. “What I am?”
       “Bother. That’s a tiny ass word for a gory big thing.” He scratches his
buzzed head. “A crotch rash bothers me. Bad fish bothers me. Entitled
dickweeds bother me. This …” He shrugs. “Piss on it. You like my angle
more than any other pisshead in the worlds. Figure I’d return the favor, even
if I really am bigger than your rusty ass.”
       I laugh at that. He would have dwarfed my Red self. “You must know
what I’m here to do? It isn’t just infiltration. It will end with the fall of the
Society.”
       “Rise too high, in mud you lie.”
       “That’s it?” I ask incredulously. “You’re on board?”
       He snorts. “It took me six months on a torchShip to reach you. Three
months from Triton after Dancer showed me the truth. Was I confused?
Damn straight. But still I boarded the ship and had three months to
reconsider. Still I am here. So I think the time for second-guessing my
commitment has passed. Anyway, my Gold ‘brethren’ have been trying to
kill me since I was born.” He looks around, uncomfortable even after all
we’ve shared, despite the jamField. “Only people to ever treat me decently
are people who don’t have a reason to. LowColors. You. I think it’s time to
return the favor.”
       “And what of the others?” I ask intensely. “Pebble, Clown?”
       “Not my secret to share. Quinn would have understood,” he says
slowly, fighting back something. “Rest might go along. Thistle won’t.
Roque won’t. Not in a million years. Too in love with their own species.
Don’t know about the tall arrogant one.”
      “Victra. And Mustang?” I ask.
      “I don’t give love advice, shithead.” He stands. “Say, just because I’m
a revolutionary doesn’t mean I can’t get a massage from a Pink, does it?
That would suck sack.”
      “I don’t know,” I laugh. “I’m still figuring it out, to be honest.”
      “Slag it. I’m getting one. Back feels bloody broken.” His crooked teeth
bare themselves as he laughs. “Feels good. That’s how I know it’s right,
Reap. Despite all this shit. It feels good in here.” He taps his thin chest. “It
feels … how do you say … bloodydamn good.”
      Victra finds me after I’ve said my goodbyes to Sevro. “Augustus sent
me to tell you the Ash Lord’s stateroom is yours.”
      “Augustus is giving me the largest room?”
      “Your ship, your spoils, he said. You know how particular he is about
order.”
      “I hope you know the way. I’m already lost.”
      She motions me along. We walk in silence through the halls. I’m
weary, but happy enough knowing Sevro is with me, that Ares still believes
in me, and that Dancer is still alive out there. It’s a salve on the pain from
Quinn’s death.
      “I suppose you know my family has betrayed the ArchGovernor,” she
says.
      “I’d heard. But you’re still with us.”
      “As I said. I do what I want. Mother doesn’t control me, or my
accounts, like she does Antonia’s.” She grins sideways, watching me. “I
like you when you’re like this.”
      “Like this?” I can’t help but laugh. “What do you mean?”
      “I don’t know. You seem calm. At ease. Despite what’s happened.”
      “And you seem particularly kind,” I say.
      “Kind? A quaint fiction. But we both know I’m far from kind.”
      We walk in silence till we reach the door to my stateroom. I glance
back and see Ragnar trailing in the halls behind. If it weren’t for the
bandages on his body, I wouldn’t have seen him at all. I motion him away.
      At the door, I search Victra’s haughty eyes. “You could have sent a
lowColor to tell me I was to be in the stateroom.”
      “But then I wouldn’t get to see you.”
      “Is that the only reason?” I ask.
      She smiles mischievously. “I think I’ll keep my secrets.” After a
moment, she looks up at me. “But I do worry for you.”
      “For me?” I roll my eyes. “What are you playing at, Victra?”
      “Nothing,” she says, offended. “You’re such a hypocrite, Darrow.”
      “Me?”
      “Remember when Tactus discarded your violin because he was
suspicious that you wanted something? Now you treat me the same way.
Same as when I came to you in the gardens on Luna. Is it too much to
believe I’m your friend and care about you?” She wrinkles her nose.
“You’re making me emotional, and I hate it.”
      “I’m sorry,” I say. “You’re just …” I try to find the right words for the
tall woman. There aren’t any. So I shrug and say, “It’s hard knowing you’re
Antonia’s sister. That’s the full of it.”
      “But I’m not her.”
      “I realize th—”
      “Do you?” She reaches out and touches my face. Her lips part
searchingly. I remember the feel of them on mine before I launched myself
through the spitTube. I let her kiss me then. Even if she is a cold woman,
there is something in her heart for me. Different from Eo. Different from
Mustang. I move gently away from her hand and shake my head.
      “You are a strange man,” she says with a soft sigh, all the vulnerability
that was in her now gone. Her claws are back on. She leans back against the
wall opposite me, bending a knee and putting a boot on the wall, laughing
at me with her eyes. Here’s the Victra I know.
      “You love women, but you do not enjoy us.” Smile lines crease as her
lips part slightly. My eyes cannot help but trace the slender contours of her
neck, the strength in her slim shoulders, and the rise of her breasts. Her eyes
burn into me. “There’s much to enjoy. Do you even know how soft my skin
is?”
      I cough out a laugh. “You’re mocking me.”
      “As ever.”
      Victra is a schemer. It’s her way. But for a moment, she was
vulnerable. And seeing that … seeing that made all the difference. I kill the
sexual tension the best way I know how.
      “Good night, sister,” I say, and kiss her on the brow.
      “Sister? Sister?” She laughs dismissively as I leave. It takes her a
moment, but she calls to me.
      “Is it because you think me wicked?”
      I turn back to her. “Wicked?”
      “Is that why you’ve never wanted me?” She pauses, choosing her
words with care. “Because you look down on me?”
      “Why would you think that?” I ask gently.
      She shrugs and looks around the hall, strangely hesitant. “I don’t …”
She shakes her head, trying to find the right words. She gestures to herself.
“This is how I survive, do you understand? It’s how my mother taught me.
It’s what works.”
      “What do you say we try something new?” I offer, walking back to her.
I extend a hand. “Darrow. Contrary to popular rumor, I don’t eat glass. I
love music, dancing and I’m very fond of fresh fruit, particularly
strawberries.”
      She snorts a laugh. “So stupid. We’re reintroducing ourselves?”
      “No armor. Just two people. I’m waiting,” I say playfully.
      Rolling her eyes, she steps forward, looking either way down the hall.
She brings up her hand, fighting back a childish smile. “Victra. I like the
way stone smells before rain falls.” She makes a face, cheeks flushing red.
“And … don’t laugh. I actually hate the color gold. Green goes better with
my complexion.”
      I cannot sleep. The bodies of those I’ve left behind float in the
darkness with me. I wake a dozen times, flashes of bombs, slashing of
swords ripping into my dreams. I earned these sleepless nights. I know that,
and that’s what makes them all the harder.
      I stand and pace my new quarters, wandering its expanse. Six rooms.
A small gymnasium. A large bath. A study. All belonging to the man who
burned a moon. The father of the Furies. How could I sleep in a room like
this? I take the pegasus pendant from my pocket, almost forgetting it’s a
radium bomb.
      Wandering the halls of the ship, ghostlike, I look behind me,
wondering if Ragnar follows. I told him to sleep, but I know little of his
moods, how he thinks, what he does at night. There is much to learn.
      I pass through dimmed halls, past Orange technicians and Blue
systems operators, who quiet and bend as I pass through metal halls down
to the bowels of the ship, where Golds never tread. The ceilings are lower,
meant for the Red workers and Brown janitors. This ship is a city, an island.
All the Colors are here. I remember the roster. Thousands of jobs. Millions
of moving parts. I examine a maintenance panel. What if the Orange who
worked it were to overload the panel? What would happen? I don’t know. I
wager few Golds really do. I make a note of it.
     I continue on, hunger drawing me to the mess hall. Food could easily
be delivered to my rooms, but my valets have not yet been organized.
Anyway, I hate being waited on. In the mess hall, I find someone as
sleepless as myself sitting at a long metal table.
     Mustang.
24
Bacon and Eggs

      I slide across from her.
      “Can’t sleep?” I ask.
      She wraps her knuckles against her head. “Lot rattling around.” She
nods to the clamor of pans back in the kitchens. “The cook’s beside
himself,” she says. “Thinks I need a feast. Told him I just wanted bacon and
eggs. Pretty sure he’s disregarded everything I said. He babbled something
about pheasant. Has this Earthborn accent. Hard to understand.”
      Moments later, a Brown cook stumbles out from the kitchen, carrying
a tray of not only bacon and eggs, but pumpkin waffles, cured ham,
cheeses, sausages, fruits, and a dozen other dishes. But no pheasant. His
eyes turn the size of the waffles when he sees me. Apologizing for
something, he sets the tray down and disappears, only to reappear a minute
later with even more food.
      “How much do you think we eat?” I ask him.
      He just stares at me. “Thank you,” Mustang says. He mumbles
something inaudible and backs away bowing.
      “I think the Ash Lord was a bit different from us,” I say. Mustang
pushes the fruit toward me. “Thought you didn’t like bacon,” I say.
      She shrugs. “I had it every morning on Luna.” She delicately butters
her waffles. “Reminded me of you.” She avoids my eyes. “Why can’t you
sleep?”
      “Not much good at it.”
      “You never were. Except when you have a hole in your stomach. You
slept like a baby then.”
      I laugh. “I think comas don’t count.”
      We talk about anything but the things we should. Innocent and quiet,
like two moths dancing around the same flame. “Amazing how big the beds
are, even on a starship,” Mustang says. “Mine’s monstrous. Too big, really.”
      “Finally! Someone else agrees. Half the time, I sleep on the floor.”
      “You too?” she shakes her head. “Sometimes I hear noises and sleep in
the closet, thinking if someone’s coming for me they won’t look there.”
      “I’ve done that. Really does help.”
      “Except when the closet is big enough to fit a family of Obsidians.
Then its just as bad. She frowns suddenly. “I wonder if Obsidians cuddle.”
      “They don’t.”
      Her eyebrows rise. “Have you researched it?”
      I finish a handful of strawberries, shrugging as Mustang frowns at my
manners. “Obsidians believe in three types of touch. The Touch of Spring.
The Touch of Summer. The Touch of Winter. After the Dark Revolt, where
the Obsidians rose in arms against the iron ancestors, the Board of Quality
Control debated destroying the entire Color. You know how they gave them
religion, stole their technology. But what they wished to kill most of all was
the incredible kinship the Obsidians then possessed. So they instructed the
shaman of the tribes, bought and paid for liars, to warn against touch,
saying it weakened the spirit. So now the Obsidians touch one another in
sex. They touch each other to prevent death. And they touch each other to
kill. No cuddling.” I notice her watching me with a small smirk. “But of
course you knew all that.”
      “I did.” She smiles. “But sometimes it’s nice to remember all that’s
going on inside you.”
      “Oh.” I redden for some reason.
      “I forgot you can blush!” She watches me for a moment. “You
probably don’t know this, but one of my dissertations on Luna concentrated
on mistakes in the sociological manipulation theorems used by the Board of
Quality Control.” She cuts a sausage delicately. “I deemed them
shortsighted. The chemical sexual sterilization of the Pink genus, for
instance, has led to a tragically high suicide rate within the Gardens.”
      Tragically. Most would have said “inefficient.”
      “The rigidity of laws maintaining the hierarchy are so strict they’ll one
day break. Fifty years from now? A hundred? Who knows? There was this
one case we studied where a Gold woman fell in love with an Obsidian.
They had a blackmarket Carver alter their reproductive organs so his seed
was compatible with her eggs. They were found out and both were
executed, their Carvers killed. But things like this have happened a hundred
times. A thousand. They’re just scrubbed from the record books.”
      “It’s terrible,” I say.
      “And beautiful.”
      “Beautiful?” I ask, repulsed.
      “No one knows of these people,” she says. “No one but a handful of
Golds with access. The human spirit tries to break free, again and again, not
in hate like the Dark Revolt. But for love. They don’t mimic each other.
They aren’t inspired by others who come before them. Each is willing to
take the leap, thinking they are the first. That’s bravery. And that means it’s
a part of who we are as people.”
      Bravery. Would she say that if she knew one of those people sat across
from her? Does she live in the world of theories Harmony spoke of? Or
could she really understand …
      “So how long, I wonder,” she continues, “till a group like the Sons of
Ares finds the records, broadcasts them? They did it with Persephone. The
girl who sang. It’s only a matter of time.” She pauses, squinting at me as I
react involuntarily to the mention of Eo. “What’s wrong?”
      I can’t tell her what I’m thinking, so I lie. “Dissertations. Sociology.
You and I specialize in very different things. I always wondered what your
life was like on Luna.”
      Mustang eyes me playfully. “Oh? So you thought about me?”
      “Maybe.”
      “Day and night? What is Mustang wearing? What is she dreaming
about? What boy is she kiss—?”
      She winces at that last part.
      “Darrow, I want to explain something.”
      “You don’t have to,” I say, waving her off.
      “With Cassius it—”
      “Mustang, you don’t owe me anything. You weren’t mine. You aren’t
mine. You can do what you want when you want with whomever you
want.” I pause. “Even though he is a gorydamn jackass.”
      She snorts a laugh. The humor fades as fast as it came. There’s pain in
her eyes. In her half-opened mouth. Her idle knife and fork hover over her
forgotten plate. She looks down and shakes her head.
      “I wanted it to be different,” she says.
      “Mustang …” I rest my hand on her wrist. Despite her strength, it’s
frail in my hard hands. Frail as the other girl’s was when I held her in the
deepmines. I couldn’t help that girl. And now I feel like I can’t help this
woman. Would that my hands were meant to build. I would know what to
say. What to do. Maybe in another life I would have been that man. In this
one, my words, like my hands, are clumsy. All they can do is cut. All they
can do is break. “I think I know how you feel—”
      Mustang jerks back from me. “How I feel?”
      “I didn’t mean—” I pause, hearing a noise.
      We look over and the cook stands there awkwardly with another tray.
He tiptoes forward and then leaves the room, backing away awkwardly.
      “Darrow. Shut up and listen.” She peers fiercely up at me through the
strands of hair that have fallen across her face. “You want to know how I
feel? I’ll spit it out at you. All my life I’ve been taught to regard my family
over all else.
      “What happened with my brother at the Institute … when I handed
him over to you, that set me against everything I was raised to do. But I
thought that you …” She takes a deep breath that wavers at the end. “…
were a person who earned my loyalty. And I thought that it would be so
much more important if I gave it to you in that moment than to Adrius, who
has never lifted a finger on my behalf. I knew it was the right thing to do,
but it was a repudiation of my father, of all he taught me. Do you even
know what that means? He has broken families as easily as other men break
sticks. He wields unimaginable power. But more than that. He is the man
who taught me to ride horses, to read poems and not just the military
histories. The man who stood beside me, letting me raise myself up by my
own strength when I fell. The man who couldn’t look at me for three years
after my mother died. That is the man I rejected for you. No,” she corrects
herself, “not for you. For living differently, living for more. More than
pride.
      “At the Institute you and I decided to break the rules, to be decent in a
place of horror. So we made an army of loyal friends instead of slaves. We
chose to be better. Then you spat in the face of that by leaving to become
one of my father’s killers.” She puts a finger in the air. “No. Don’t speak.
It’s not your turn just because I pause.”
      She takes her time in gathering her thoughts, folding her hands.
      “Now, I’m sure you understand that I felt lost. One, because I thought
I’d found someone special in you. Two, because I felt you were abandoning
the idea that gave us the ability to conquer Olympus. Consider that I was
vulnerable. Lonely. And that perhaps I fell into Cassius’s bed because I was
hurt and needed a salve to my pain. Can you imagine that? You may
answer.”
      I squirm on my cushion. “I suppose.”
      “Good. Now shove that idea up your ass.” Her lips make a hard line. “I
am not some frill-wearing tramp. I am a genius. I say this because it is a
fact. I am smarter than any person you’ve ever met, except perhaps my
twin. My heart does not make my brain a fool. I sought out a relationship
with Cassius for the same reason I let the Sovereign think she was turning
me against my father: to protect my family.”
      She looks down at her food.
      “I’ve always been able to manipulate people. Men, women, it makes
no difference. Cassius was a walking wound, Darrow, raw and bloody
despite the fact it has been two years since you killed Julian. I saw it in him
in a second, and I knew how I could make him love me. I gave him
someone to who would listen, someone who would fill the void.”
      The sternness in her voice fades. She looks around as if she could
escape the conversation she started. If she stopped, I would be happier for
it.
      “I made him think he could not live without me. I knew it was the only
thing that could keep the rest of my house safe. I knew it was the best
weapon I could wield in this game. Yet … I felt so cold. So horrible. Like I
was the cruel witch snaring Odysseus, making him fall in love, keeping him
for my own selfish aims. It seemed so logical. And when he put his arms
around me, I felt like I was drowning. Like I was lost, suffocating under the
weight of all I’d done, suffocating knowing there was a life ahead of me
with someone I did not love.
      “Yet it was for family. It was for the people I love even if they don’t
deserve it. Many have sacrificed more. I could sacrifice that.” She shakes
her head, the tears that build there mirroring those that well in my own
eyes. They fall when she says, “Then you walked in at the gala, and … and
it was like the ground had broken open to swallow me. I felt a fraud. A
wicked girl who’d contrived a reason to do something stupid.” She tries to
wipe her eyes. “Can’t you see why I did it? I didn’t want you to die. I don’t
want you to die. Not like my brother, Claudius. Not like Pax. I would have
done anything to stop it.”
      “I can stop it.”
      “You’re not invincible, Darrow. I know you think you are. But one day
you’ll find out you aren’t as strong as you think you are, and I’ll be alone.”
      She goes silent as all that has welled up inside her breaks loose. She
does not sob. But the tears come. She’s the type of woman to be
embarrassed by them.
      It breaks me to see this.
      “You are not wicked,” I say as I take her hand in mine. “You are not
cruel.” She shakes her head, trying to pull away. I take her jaw between the
fingers of my right hand and bend her head till her eyes find a home in
mine. “And what you do for the people you love cannot be judged. Do you
understand?” I deepen my voice. “Do you understand?”
      She nods.
      It should not be this way. The Golds have everything, yet they demand
sacrifices even from their own. This place is sick. This empire broken. It
eats its kings, its queens, as hungrily as it does the paupers who mill its
earth. But it cannot have this woman as it had the girl I buried. I will not let
it devour her. I will not let it devour my family in Lykos. I will break it.
      I wipe the tears from her face with my thumb. She is different from
them. And when she tries to do as they do, it cracks her heart to the core.
Looking at her, I know I was wrong. She is not a distraction. She does not
compromise my mission. She is the point of it all. Yet I cannot kiss her. Not
now when I must break her heart to break this empire. It would not be fair.
I’ve fallen in love with her, but she’s fallen for a lie.
      “You can’t trust him,” she says quietly.
      “Who?” I ask, startled by her sudden words.
      “My twin,” she whispers as though he sits in the corner of the room.
“He’s not a man like you. He’s something else. When he looks at us, when
he looks at people, he sees sacks of bone and meat. We don’t really exist to
him.” I frown as she clutches my hand. “Darrow, listen to me. He is the
monster they don’t know how to write stories about. You cannot trust him.”
      The way she says it makes me know she understands our pact.
      “I don’t trust him,” I say. “I need him.”
      “We can win this war without him,” she says.
      “I thought you said I wasn’t strong enough.”
      “You’re not,” she says with a smile. “Not by yourself.” She dons her
lopsided grin. “You need me.”
      If only it were so simple.
      I leave Mustang for my rooms soon after. The halls are quiet, and I feel
a shade drifting through some metal realm. I don’t know how to accept her
help. Or how I should handle her. Seeing her with Cassius wounded me
more than I’ll ever tell her, and part of me knows not all of it could have
been a manipulation. He was never a monster; and if he ever becomes one, I
know it will be because of me.
     The door to my suite hisses open. A hand settles over my shoulder. I
turn to see Ragnar’s chest. I didn’t even hear him. “Someone breathes
inside.”
     “Theodora probably. She’s my Pink steward. You’ll like her.”
     “Gold breath.”
     I nod, not asking how he knows, and take my razor from my arm. It
whispers into a sword as I step through. The lights are on, muted. I search
the suite’s rooms with Ragnar to find the Jackal sitting in my lounge with a
sherry. He chuckles at our weapons.
     “I do admit, I am quite threatening.”
     He’s wearing a bathrobe and slippers.
     I excuse Ragnar. With his wounds, he should be in the medical bay.
Reluctantly, he trudges out.
     “Seems no one sleeps on this ship,” I say as I join the Jackal on the
couch. “I imagine we have to restructure our arrangement a bit.”
     “Fond of understatements, aren’t you?” He sips the liquor and sighs.
“Thought I’d drown in that damn lagoon. I always thought my death would
be something grand. Launched into the sun. Beheaded by a political rival.
Then when it came …” He shudders, looking so very frail and boyish. “It
was just a careless coldness. Like the rocks of the Institute falling all around
me again in that mine.”
     There is no warmth in death. I cried like a child when I thought I was
dying after Cassius stabbed me.
     “Obviously this changes our strategy, but I don’t believe it must
change our alliance.”
     “Nor do I,” I agree. “We’ll need your spies more than ever. Pliny won’t
take my ascension lightly. And you’re stuck here in your father’s court. The
Politico will try to remove us both.” I make no mention of the Sons of Ares.
As I guessed, they were forgotten by all as soon as I tipped that wine onto
Cassius’s lap.
     “Pliny will have to go. But you and I should maintain social distance
until then so he doesn’t know the threat against him is unified. Better for
him to misunderstand our individual resources”
     “And so the Telemanuses still talk with me,” I say.
     “True. They do want me dead.”
     “As they should.”
     “I don’t begrudge them it. It’s just damn inconvenient.” He hands me a
holoCom from his pocket. “They’re synced. I’ll be calling my ships to meet
us, and I imagine you’ll stay here with your new prize. Wouldn’t do to have
shuttles going back and forth.”
     I want to ask him about Leto. Why he killed him. But why show a
devil you know his strength? It just makes me a threat to him. And I’ve
seen how he deals with threats. Better to play ignorant and make sure I’m
always useful.
     “War presents us with more opportunities,” I say. “Depending on how
far we want it to spread …”
     `”I do believe I take your meaning.”
     “All others will try to suffocate the flames, to preserve what they have.
Especially Pliny, and your sister.”
     “Well, then we must be cleverer.”
     “She doesn’t get hurt. That part of our agreement is static.”
     “If ever she’s wounded, I believe it’ll be from you, not me.” He might
be right. “But I’m on your level: Fan the flames. Spread the war. Win it.
Take the spoils.”
     “I think I know just how to do it. What can your network tell me about
the shipyards of Ganymede?”
   PART III
 CONQUER
When falls the Iron Rain, be brave. Be brave.
           —Lorn au Arcos
25
Praetors

      “We are undone, that is what the ArchGovernor of Callisto has said.”
ArchGovernor Nero au Augustus peers around the table to see if we
understand the gravity of his words. The aquiline angles of his face catch
the ship’s warroom lights, hollowing his cheeks and giving him the look of
a falcon peering down its beak. “And why should he not? The Core rallies
against us. Neptune is in farOrbit—Vespasian’s ships will be six months in
coming to reinforce us. All this while my own bannermen hide behind their
shields in their cities on Mars, sending only their second- and third-born to
aid us.” He looks at the two far members of the table. “Their feebleness
cripples us. And now I sit here in council with my Praetors, my men of
arms, and what grand schemes do they devise?”
      Run. That’s what they say. We fled Luna a month ago. And we’ve not
stopped running since, because the Sovereign was crafty and her forces beat
us to Mars.
      This is not how I thought it would go. But then again, none of this is
my damn fault. Cautious bloody fools surround the ArchGovernor. Golds
too frightened to lose all the favor and power they’ve gained in the past to
risk any of it now. Worse, they squeeze me out. Alliances form against me.
You can see it in their eyes, in their shoulders. My gain is their loss. Even
those who followed my lead on Luna. Even those I saved from certain
death. They do the same to the Jackal, and they think it a victory he is not
here in this room bickering with them. Their mistake.
      I sit ten chairs down from my master at the massive cherry oak table in
the warroom of his flagship, the six-kilometer dreadnought Invictus. The
ceiling is forty meters above us. The room overly grand and imposing. A
carved relief of a lion glares out from the center of the table. Over forty
places are empty. Trusted advisors gone, having abandoned Augustus like
rats from a sinking ship. Those with us are Pliny, Praetor Kavax, his son
Daxo, and a half a hundred of Augustus’s most powerful Praetors, Legates,
and bannermen. They do not glare at me. Nothing so childish. These Golds
preside over a billion souls. So they simply ignore me and push doubt into
Augustus about my ideas.
      “Are we in agreement, then, with the ArchGovernor of Callisto? Are
we undone?” Augustus demands.
      Before any can answer, the grand doors hiss open, retracting into the
marbled walls. Mustang strolls through, tossing an apple hand to hand.
      “Apologies for my tardiness!” She beams at her father, approaches him
and gives him a too-gracious kiss on his lionhead ring.
      “I sent word over an hour ago,” Augustus says.
      “Oh?” Mustang spares a look at Pliny. “I must have missed it. I only
knew you were here because I went looking for my brother to play a game
of chess.” She laughs at the joke. Only the Telemanuses get it. Sighing, she
makes her way to the far end of the table, squeezing Daxo and Kavax on
their shoulders as she passes. Kavax greets her with rumbling, warm words.
She sits and kicks her military boots up. “Did I miss anything? Of course I
didn’t. Dithering as always?”
      Her father’s cheek twitches. “This is not a stable.” He eyes her boots.
Sighing, she brings her boots down and shines the apple on her black
sleeve.
      She’s one of a very few women in the room. Agrippina au Julii should
be here, but it was her betrayal that depleted Augustus’s fleet of the
numbers he needed to capture Mars quickly. And it was her betrayal that’s
made Augustus put men on Victra to make sure her loyalty to him is true. It
took nearly all of my clout with the man to keep her out of the brig.
      We’ve been chased from the Core worlds here, far beyond the orbital
path of Mars. Our asteroid mining operations are seized. His assets frozen.
And Augustus’s cities, those that did not surrender already to the Sovereign,
are besieged. Not to mention there are bounties for our heads. The old men
don’t like that I have the second-highest bounty behind Augustus.
      “Before we were interrupted,” Augustus continues, “I believe someone
was justifying their pos—” Snap. His voice falls away as Mustang takes a
loud bite of her apple. She looks around at the annoyed faces. I stifle a
laugh.
      “My liege.” Pliny leans forward. “I’m afraid there is no alternative but
to continue our tactical retreat. If things continue in this manner, we will
lose. And you, my liege, will be tried for—” Snap. He flinches before
finishing, “—treason.” He looks around the table to his bought-and-paid-for
allies. “There is but one path available to us.”
      “Continue to run with our fleet till Vespasian’s reinforcements arrive
from Neptune,” Augustus murmurs. “In six months.”
      The Politico nods. “Or surrender.”
      “Would that you had killed Octavia when you had the chance, boy,”
Kavax says.
      “If I had, everyone here would be dead,” I reply.
      Daxo nods. “He meant no offense. Wistful thinking.”
      “Why didn’t you kill Octavia?” Pliny squints at me skeptically.
      “I couldn’t have. I was in a room with Aja au Grimmus. Perhaps if you
were there, you could have done better, but I’m a mortal man.”
      The Praetors who know their business laugh.
      “Even Lorn au Arcos wouldn’t have dared,” Augustus mutters. “And I
once saw him kill Stained without a razor. Darrow did as he could.” He
turns his attention on me. “Do you think we should run now as well?”
      “It makes you look weak.”
      “We are weak,” Pliny replies. “But this makes him look wise.”
      “Wise men read books about history, Pliny. Strong men write them.”
      “Stop quoting Lorn au Arcos!” Pliny snaps.
      “I thought you’d be open to all knowledge.”
      “Your many years of life no doubt make you an authority on
innumerable things,” Pliny says melodically. “Do recycle more maxims
from old warriors so we may learn more of life and wisdom.”
      “This isn’t about me, dear Pliny. So cut the ad hominems.” I gesture to
the ArchGovernor “This is about our liege. This is about his fate.”
      “How theatrical of you to note, Darrow.” Augustus rubs his eyes, tired.
      “The young can’t help but be eager,” Pliny continues. “But we must
remember, there is no dishonor in prudence, my liege. Six months’ delay is
a small price to pay for victory.” He splays out his long-fingered hands. “In
fact, time is our friend. Octavia cannot afford to scour the Solar System for
us. Not with the Senate so divided at home. Her grasping hand will be like
iron. It will rake along the backs of the other ArchGovernors, and it will not
be long before those who follow her begin to chafe at her orders. They will
learn why we fight against her; namely that she is not our representative,
but is instead an Empress. This will give us time. Which will give us power.
Which will give us the ability to sue for profitable peace.”
      Praetor Kavax slams his fist on the table. “Piss on this.”
      A titan of a man, he’s carved more from rock than flesh. His neck is so
thick that I couldn’t wrap even my hands around it. Unlike most Golds, he
has shaved his head and permitted his beard to grow. It is thick and dyed
blood-red. When the lights dim, it glows like a brand in the night. Only
three fingers remain on his left hand. They say his son, Daxo, bit them off
as a child. Though Daxo always smiles and with his soft voice suggests that
it was his younger brother, Pax. The Telemanuses are the only Praetors in
the room not beholden, in one way or another, to Pliny. I like Kavax.
      “It chafes my balls. This Pixie talk chafes my balls!” Kavax sneers.
“We should not be in this position. Give me leave, my liege, and I will take
a thousand of my guard to treat with the cowards who did not answer your
summons. Apologies, my darling,” he whispers to his favorite fox,
Sophocles, a red-gold, sharp-eared thing that flinches at the loud sound of
its master’s voice. Sophocles eats little jelly beans from Kavax’s massive
palm.
      We wait for Kavax’s attention to return to his words.
      “You were saying, Kavax?” Augustus prods with a quick smile he
reserves for his favorites.
      “Father.” Daxo nudges the larger man.
      Kavax looks up, startled. “Oh. And when their balls are ripped off and
made to dangle from their own earlobes, others will remember you are ruler
of Mars and they will beg to aid you, Nero.”
      Satisfied, he goes back to feeding Sophocles jelly beans.
      “And they will know that we few lords were found loyal,” Daxo
quickly adds, waving to the Golds around the table, who nod appreciatively.
Daxo sucks on a stick of cinnamon. He smiles even more than Pax, though
his are half as grand and twice as mischievous. The only frown I’ve yet
seen on his face was when he saw the Jackal at the gala.
      That particular grudge will not fade. Nor should it. The Jackal took
their Pax. In reply, the Telemanuses demanded his head. In turn, Augustus
banished the Jackal from Mars. But now war brings new complications,
new necessities. And the Jackal seems to have been forgiven in his father’s
eyes, if not those of the Telemanuses. I watch them carefully. They are not
stupid, despite the guise they enjoy wearing. I only hope they remain
ignorant of my alliance with Pax’s killer.
      “All should be reminded that fealty is not easily cast off,” Daxo
finishes, his voice astonishingly cordial. “A visit from my father and my
sisters would remind other bannermen of their duties to you in times of
war.” He tilts his head playfully, allowing us to admire the workmanship of
the gold angels engraved into his scalp. “It is in the Telemanus nature to
leave an impression. Perhaps it would swell our ranks.”
      “My thunder lords.” Augustus smiles. “Ever eager for violence.” He
traces a finger along the back of his long left hand. “But no. That reminder
must wait. Punishment can only be doled out in victory. It would look petty,
the sad flailing of a drowning man, considering my fleet is scattered and my
legions trapped behind the shields of my cities.”
      He looks to Pliny and asks how the rest of our trade allies fare. I sneak
a glance at Mustang. She notices and raises an eyebrow at me, wondering
when we shall begin.
      “All our Politicos have been received,” Pliny says slowly. Today, Pliny
wears a very serious coat of black lipstick. “As you know, my Politicos and
I conferred after we fled from Luna. And we developed a rather advanced
theoretical breakdown of potential alliance shifts—”
      “With computers?” Kavax asks with a booming laugh.
      “With computers,” Pliny continues, irritated. “Simulations were
performed by my Green analysts. Of the Galilean Moons—Io, Calisto,
Ganymede, and Europa—none will cast their lot with us. Neither in
simulation nor actuality.”
      “Hardly surprising,” a hawkish Praetor mutters. “We had the same
results from the moons of Saturn.”
      Pliny continues. “Naturally, they fear the repercussions of choosing the
wrong side. The Saturn Governors are a lost cause for now. They see Rhea’s
corpse in their sky every day. In the Galilean sector, the presence of Lorn au
Arcos on Europa is a problem. His … isolationist political leanings have
proven infectious to the ArchGovernors of Jupiter’s moons, particularly
since his private army is twice again as large as any of the
ArchGovernors’.”
      “Isolation? More like retirement.” Augustus sighs. “Perhaps he has the
right of it.”
      “You would go mad, Father,” Mustang says from the end of the table.
“No scheming, no plots or stratagems. Just family and time to spend with
Adrius and me.”
      His smile is tight, unreadable. “How well my daughter knows me.”
      “What worries me most,” Pliny says, “is that the Galileans, in their
own words, doubt the validity of our cause.”
      “That’s because we don’t have a cause,” I moan, remembering my
role. “At least not so far as anyone else cares.”
      “Explain,” the ArchGovernor demands.
      “He’s getting to it, father,” Mustang says. “Darrow plays for drama.”
      I make a show of looking around the room. “It’s safe to say that the
gentle Golds in this room understand human nature. Yes? Even if we did
not, what motivates us? A cause? No. None of us have a cause. Freedom?
Liberty? Justice?” I roll my eyes. “Hardly. What do we care that the
Sovereign acts like an Empress? What do we care about the Compact and
the liberties it extends Golds? Nothing.
      “This is about power. It is always about power. We fight her because
we attached ourselves to a star, the ArchGovernor. But the star falls, fades
…”
      Kavax half rises from his seat. “Don’t insult your lord as if—”
      “As if he’s what? A fool? He’s not, so come off it. The Bellona take
Mars. They will get the contracts, the government positions. We will be
pushed to the fringe, dead or irrelevant.” My voice plays with the audience.
“Power is the only thing of worth in this world. Consider Tactus au Valii-
Rath—a loyal ally of mine for three years. But as soon as my star began to
fall, he stole from me and departed out the back door. A thief in the night.
      “How many empty seats are here that were filled before Luna? So
many men and women who would have bled for Augustus. So many men
and women who would have given their eyes for him when he sat on his
dais in Agea. Now …”
      I dust off my hands.
      “We are losing. To run is to wither and die. If we want to rise again,
draw the Galileans to our cause, marshal the Governors of Saturn to our
banners, then we show them we are not powerless. Show them we drip with
power. We are arbiters of life and death. We, not the Bellona, are the House
of Mars.”
      Pliny begins to say something, but Augustus motions him to be quiet.
      “What would you propose?”
      “The Galilean families are soft for Luna for one reason. Commerce.
Ganymede has her shipyards. Calisto is little more than a factory of Grays
and Obsidians for the Society’s armies. Europa is an oceanworld of banking
and deepsea mining and vacation homes. Io is the breadbasket to any world
along Jupiter’s orbital path. They depend too much on commerce with the
Core to run to our side. And even the basest child knows what happened
when the Ash Lord descended upon Rhea.” The Praetors nod along. “So we
must impress them. We must terrify them so that they know our power can
touch them at any time and they cannot risk alienating us.”
      “How?” Augustus asks. They’re all on the hook now.
      I set my razor on the table so they know what business I propose. “We
take their ships. We take their children. We take them as allies as the
Spartans took their wives. By force, in the night.”
      Silence forms around me. Then comes the uproar. Pliny lets his
Praetors slash at the idea. His energy he spends whispering in Augustus’s
ear. I glance at Mustang, but she watches the others, gauging them.
      “Boasts.” The ArchGovernor quiets the room and readdresses me.
“I’ve not heard a plan.”
      “One plan. Two parts.”
      I touch a datapad, and the holo the Jackal’s agents gave me expands
over the table to show Ganymede. The moon shines bright with blues and
greens from its oceans and forests, brilliant against the marbled white and
orange of Jupiter’s vaporous surface. Gray shipyards ring the moon. I zoom
in so that they stretch across and above the table. I list the ships registered,
highlighting one in particular. “Ganymede has a moonBreaker.”
      Whistles from around the table. “A moonBreaker?” someone whispers.
      “Is this information reliable?” Augustus asks.
      I nod. “Very.” My fingers twitch, rotating the image of the docks. In
the shadow of an orbital dock floats a ship like my Pax, but newer, larger.
Black as night, and eight kilometers in length. “The Sovereign herself
commissioned it as a present for her grandson.”
      Kavax nearly drools at the sight of the monster of a ship. “What a
loving woman.”
      “Assuming this is not contrived.” Pliny inspects the holo. “How did
you come upon the information?”
      “Little birds whisper into my ears too.”
      “Don’t be coy. It is important.”
      “My sources are mine, just as yours are your own, Pliny.”
    “So you want to steal the moonBreaker from Ganymede?” Pliny asks.
“That’s an act of war.”
    I chuckle. “No. You misunderstand. I want to steal all of the ships.”
26
Puppet Master

     Pliny glances worriedly at Augustus. “Do this, and this war does not
end till one side is ash.”
     “It’s already that way …,” Kavax begins.
     “This is different,” Pliny crows. “It expands the scope.”
     “My father is right,” Daxo declares. “We are already in open
rebellion.”
     Pliny slaps his hand down. “This is different. This declares war on the
Society, not the Bellona, not the Sovereign as a singular person. Ganymede
has not harmed us. This will fracture everything.”
     Augustus sits quietly, his cold eyes staring at the moonBreaker on the
holo. Without looking at me, he asks, “You said there were two parts to this
plan. What is the second?”
     I change the holo. The Academy replaces the shipyards. Ships ring its
dull gray surface. Asteroids rotate in the backdrop.
     “Those ships are ancient,” a balding Praetor named Licenus says
before I can begin. “Useless in a fight. Is your plan to steal them too?”
     “No, Praetor Licenus. My plan is to steal the students.” I add another
visual. Mars’s Institute joins the Academy. Then another Institute, Venus’s.
Then Earth’s two Institutes. Then the Galilean Institutes and Saturn’s. Then
more till nearly a dozen images float in the air. “I want to steal all of the
students. Not to fight. But to ransom.”
     “Goryhell.” Mustang bursts out laughing. “Are you insane, Darrow?”
     Augustus frowns. “Virginia, control yourself.”
     “I am under control, Father. Your attack dog isn’t.”
     “You forget your place.”
     “And you forget how Claudius looked, dead on the ground. Leto too.
Do you want that for the rest of us?” She regrets the words as soon as they
leave her lips.
     “Shut your mouth, girl.” Augustus shudders with wrath. His bony
fingers clutch the edge of the table till it creaks. “You’ve been unhinged
since you let that Bellona boy between your legs. Walking in here like a
Pixie pomp. Eating that apple like a child. Stop being a sideshow whore and
live up to your name.”
      “Like your remaining son?” she asks.
      He takes a long, calming breath. “You will be quiet or you will leave.”
      Mustang grinds her teeth together, but stays uncharacteristically silent.
Pliny’s lips curl in a rather pleased smile.
      “Don’t blame her, my goodmen, if she’s already tired of war,” Pliny
says, softly placing a knife in a wounded enemy. “After so many nocturnal
summits spent engaging in horizontal diplomacy with the Bellona, her
stamina isn’t what it used to be.”
      Kavax lunges at Pliny. Daxo pulls him back just in time. But it’s
Mustang who is first to speak over the uproar.
      “I can defend my own honor, my goodman. But from Pliny, such
insults are to be expected After all, I would be bitter too if my wife bent
over backwards to make sure so many of your young mercenaries learned
how to properly sheathe their swords.”
      Pliny stares angrily at her as she rises, continuing, “I left Mars to
pursue knowledge in the Sovereign’s court. I did not abandon my family, as
so many of you have suggested. And I’m not sorry I left and missed
conversations such as this. For you goodmen seem good only at one thing,
and that is bickering. Yet you quickly come to agreement upon me as an
item of ridicule. Curious. Is it because you see me as a threat to your
power? Or is it simply because I’m a woman?” She peers at the few
scattered women around the table. “If that is the case, you forget
yourselves. This Society was founded by men and women based on merit.
      “The dear Politico Pliny is right, however: I would have avoided this
war. In fact, I tried. Why else do you think I allowed Cassius au Bellona to
court me? But war is here. And I will protect my family again from all
threats, those from without and from within.”
      Augustus lets slip the smallest, barest of smiles, a twin to the first. His
love is the most conditional I’ve ever seen. How quickly he can call his
daughter a whore, then smile as she reclaims what power she lost in the
room. Suddenly, she matters.
      “Then what do you think of my plan?” I ask.
      “I think it is dangerous. It spreads the war without ensuring our
benefit. It is immoral and sets dangerous precedent. But then again, war is
inherently immoral. So we must simply decide how far we want to go.”
      “You know Octavia better than I,” I say. “How far will she go?”
      Mustang is quiet for a moment. “If we have a victory and sue for peace
either from a position of strength or weakness, she will accept the
overture.…”
      “You see!” Pliny beams.
      Mustang isn’t finished. “She will suggest a neutral location. And on
that day when we go to make peace, she will do everything in her power to
kill all of us.”
      Pliny looks back and forth between us, realizing how easily he’s been
played.
      “So there is no going back? Win or die?” I ask flatly.
      “Indeed, Darrow,” she says with a smile. “Win or die.”
      “It seems you’ve been outmaneuvered, Pliny. We move forward with
Darrow’s plan.” Augustus stands. “Tomorrow, Praetor Licenus will take
command of this vessel and its fleet and lead the Sovereign’s fleet on a
chase, while I take a small strike group of corvettes and frigates to the Gas
Giants. With them, I will raid the shipyards of Ganymede.”
      “I will go with you, my liege!” Kavax booms. His fox jumps off his
lap at the noise to tremble under the table.
      “No.”
      Kavax’s face falls. “No? But, Nero … the defenses there—battle
stations, destroyers, torchShips—they will shred any force of corvettes you
bring.” His large hands gesture imploringly. “Let us do this for you.”
      “You forget who I am, my friend.”
      “Apologies, I did not mean …”
      Augustus waves the apology away and turns to Mustang. “Daughter,
you will take what elements of the fleet you need to execute the second
portion of Darrow’s plan.”
      Watching Pliny now is like watching a child try to hold on to a handful
of sand. He doesn’t understand the course things have taken. But he’s not
fool enough to make his play now. He will wait in the grass like the snake
he is.
      The ArchGovernor turns to me. “Darrow, what did you say to me
before you shed Cassius’s blood?”
      “I said that you should be King of Mars.”
      “My friends.” Augustus sets his thin hands down on the table, fingers
rigid. “Darrow has demonstrated powers none of you possess. He predicts
what I want. I want to be king. Make me so. Dismissed.”
     The room empties. I wait with Augustus. He wants a private word.
     Mustang brushes close to me as she passes, winking playfully.
     “Nice speech,” I mutter.
     “Nice plan.”
     She squeezes my hand and then she is gone.
     “In league again,” Augustus observes. He gestures me to close the
door. I sit near him. The hard lines of his face deepen as he stares into my
eyes. From a distance, the lines are invisible. But this close, they are the
things that make his face. Loss gives a man lines like this, reminding me,
This is the man you do not anger. The man you do not owe.
     “We can do away with righteous indignation before it finds a place on
your tongue.” He steeples his fingers, examining the manicured cuticles.
“The question is simple, and you will answer it: Are you a demokrat?”
     I had not expected this. I try not to look around nervously.
     “No, my liege. I am no demokrat.”`
     “Not a Reformer? Not someone who wants to alter our Compact to
create a more fair, more decent society?”
     “Man is organized properly now,” I say, pausing, “except for a few
notable exceptions.”
     “Pliny?”
     “Pliny.”
     “You each have your gifts. And you would do well not to question my
judgment in keeping him close.”
     “Yes, my liege. But I am no more a demokrat than you are a Lune.”
     He does not smile as I intended. Instead, he presses a button and the
speech I used to win over the Pax comes on the speakers. An HC holo
shows the faces of different Colors.
     “Watch their expressions.” He watches mine as he cycles through a
series of video clips from different parts of the ship as the crew listens to
the speech I gave before they rose against their Gold commanders. “Do you
see that? That right there. The spark? Do you?”
     “I see it.”
     “That is hope.” The man who killed my wife waits for my face to give
me away. Good luck with that. “Hope.”
     “Are you saying I made a mistake?” I ask.
      He recalls old words. “Hateful to me as the gates of Hades is that man
who hides one thing in his heart and speaks another.”
      “My heart has always been laid bare.”
      “So you say.” His lips part slightly, hissing the words. “But as
terrorists spread lies over the net, as bombings wrack our cities, as the
lowColors rumble with displeasure, as we begin a war despite the termites
in our foundation, you say this.”
      “Any chaos is—”
      “Shut your mouth. Do you know what would happen if the other
Governors thought us Reformers? If the other houses looked at mine as a
bastion of equality and demokracy?” He points to a glass. “Our potential
allies.” He brushes the glass off the table, letting it shatter. Points to another.
“Our lives.” It falls and shatters too. “It is bad enough my daughter had the
ear of the Reformer bloc on Luna. You cannot seem political. Stay a
warrior. Stay simple. Do you understand?”
      What if the lowColors rally to us? I want to ask, but he would have his
Obsidians kill me where I stand.
      “I understand.”
      “Good.” Augustus looks at his hands, twisting the ring there.
Hesitancy creeps over him. “Can I trust you?”
      “In what way?”
      A scornful laugh bursts from his mouth. “Most would say yes without
thinking.”
      “Most men are liars.”
      “Can I trust you with power autonomous from my own?” He scratches
his jaw idly. “That is when many leave their lords. It is when hunger fills
their eyes. The Romans learned this time and again. It is why they did not
let generals cross the Rubicon with their armies without the permission of
the Senate. Men with armies soon begin to realize how strong they are. And
they always know that their particular strength is not forever. It must be
used with haste, before their army leaves them. But hasty decisions can ruin
empires. My son, for instance, must never be allowed such power.”
      “He has his businesses.”
      “That is a slow power. Cleverly done on his part, if unfit for my name.
Slow power can grind away any stagnant enemy. But fast power, one that
can travel where you go, do what you wish it to as effectively as a hammer
hitting a nail, that is the power that lops off heads and steals crowns. Can I
trust you with it?”
      “You must. I am the only man who can go to Lorn.”
      Surprise flashes in his eyes; he is unused to having his machinations
guessed. He buries the surprise quickly, unwilling to give credit where
credit is due. “You knew already.”
      “You wish me to approach Lorn, ask for his help, because he taught me
the razor.”
      “And because he loves you.”
      I blink dumbly. “I’m not sure that’s the word.”
      “He had four sons. Three died in front of him. And then the last in an
accident, as you know. I believe you remind him of them, though you’re in
fact more capable and less moral, which is to your advantage. But as much
as he loves you, Lorn hates me.”
      “He hates Octavia more, my liege.”
      “Still. It won’t be easy to convince him to join us.”
      “Then I won’t give him a choice.”
27
Jelly Beans

      The Telemanuses wait for me in the hall. Kavax takes me into a hug
that cracks my back. Daxo nods his head. I’m left feeling dazed between the
two of them. It is the first time I’ve spoken to either without violence afoot.
Truth be told, I’ve avoided them for shame of what I let happen to Pax.
      “My boy only ever lost to you,” Kavax says. “Little Pax. If he was to
fall to a knee, it is no shame to have fallen in friendship. I only wish he
could have taken Olympus with you. That would have been a sight.”
      “I would have liked to have seen him take Proctor Jupiter’s armor.”
      Daxo grins. “I was Jupiter House myself. Primus till I lost to Karnus
au Bellona.”
      “Then I believe we have a mutual enemy.”
      “Besides the scheming little bastard that killed my baby brother?”
Daxo asks softly. “We have many shared enemies, Andromedus.”
      Kavax scoops up his fox. It licks his neck and peers fiercely at me
before it nuzzles into his thick red beard. It has a white chest, black legs,
and dark russet fur covering the rest of its body. Thicker and hardier than a
normal fox, and weighing nearly thirty-five kilograms, it really is more
wolflike in size.
      “Foxes are beautiful creatures,” Kavax says, stroking the beast.
      Daxo nods. “Mischievous. Omnivorous. Resistant to poaching.
Monogamous. Very special, and able to expand their hunting grounds even
in the territory of wolves.” He looks up at me darkly. “But because of a
damn quirk of nature, foxes fare poorly against jackals. We asked Augustus
to banish Adrius. For a time, he was, yet now he returns to the fleet.”
      “A crime,” I say.
      They nod.
      Daxo sets a hand on my shoulder. “The girls—my sisters and mother, I
mean—wanted you to know that we do not hold you accountable for Pax’s
death. We loved that little boy, and we know you only ever mean him
honors. We know you named your ship for him. And will not forget it. Once
friends, always friends. That is our family’s way.”
      Kavax nods to every word his remaining son says. He tosses his fox a
handful of jelly beans.
      “So if you need us,” Daxo suggests, nodding to the warroom, “you
need merely ask, and the House Telemanus will lend itself to your cause.”
      “You mean that?” I ask.
      “It would have made my Pax happy,” older Kavax rumbles.
      I clasp his hand and try my luck. “You’ll forgive me for my manners,
but I need you now.”
      Great eyebrows arch as the two behemoths share a look of surprise.
“Investigate, Sophocles! Investigate,” Kavax says excitedly. The large fox
at his legs slips forward warily to investigate me, sniffing my knees, peering
at my shoes and hands. It weaves through my legs in its search. Then it
pounces on me, putting forepaws on my hips and digging its snout into my
pocket. Sophocles resurfaces with two jelly beans, panting contentedly.
      “Magic!” Kavax booms, clapping me on the shoulder. “Sophocles has
discovered a propitious sign of approval, by magic! What a good omen!
Daxo, my son. Summon your sisters and mother. The Reaper calls, House
Telemanus must answer.”
      “The girls were visiting Uranus, Father. They’ll be a few months.”
      “Well, then we must answer.”
      “Couldn’t agree with you more, Father.”
      “I’ll have instructions within the hour,” I say.
      “Great anticipation!” Kavax thumps away. “We await them with great
anticipation.” He roars compliments at passing Oranges, terrifying them
with his wide-grinning approval. Daxo and I watch on.
      “Does he really believe in magic?” I ask.
      “He says gnomes steal ear wax from him at night. Mother thinks he’s
been hit too many times on the head.” Daxo backs away, following his
father. But he can’t hide his clever smile as he pops a jelly bean into his
mouth, and I see where the ones in my pocket came from. “I say he just
lives in a more entertaining world than we do. Call on us soon, Reaper.
Father is eager.”
      After meeting over holo with the Jackal to bring him up to speed on
my plan and adjusting it according to a few of his recommendations, I have
Orion set a course for Europa. It will take two weeks. Roque joins me on
the bridge, watching the skeleton crew of Blues. He doesn’t speak. Yet it’s
the first time he’s sought me out since we left Luna. It’s a weight hanging
over my head.
     “I’m sorr—” I begin.
     “I don’t want to talk about Quinn,” he says quietly. “I know you
wanted this war. Engineered it instead of trusting me to buy your contract
and protect you. What I don’t know is why you drugged me.”
     “I wanted to protect you. Because I knew I would need you after the
gala, and I couldn’t risk your safety.”
     “What about what I need?” he asks. “You don’t have the right to make
choices for me because you’re afraid it might interrupt your plans. Friends
don’t do that.”
     “You’re right. It was wrong of me.”
     “Wrong to stick a needle in my neck?”
     “Beyond wrong. But know the intent was good, even if the idea and
execution were as stupid as they come. If I have to get on my knees …”
     “There’s an image.” I know he’s joking, but his face does not laugh or
smile as he turns and walks away.
28
The Stormsons

      “You come to me at the head of a storm,” my friend says, gray beard
blowing sideways in the wind as he looks at the waves far beneath. “Did
you know there are boys here on this ocean world who take skiffs into gales
worse than this? Lads from the dregs of the Grays, Reds, even Browns.
Their bravery is a mad, crazed sort.” He points out from the balcony with a
heavy finger to the roiling black water, where waves crest ten meters high.
“They call them stormsons.”
      The gravity here is maddening. Everything floats. At 0.136 of Earth’s
gravity, every step I take must be measured, controlled, else I’ll burst
upward fifteen feet and have to wait to flutter back down. A fight here
would be like a ballet underwater. I wear gravBoots just to move
comfortably.
      The old man watches the ocean world move around his island. He is as
he always told me to be—a stone amidst the waves; wet, yet unimpressed
by all that swirls about him. Saltwater spray drips from his beard.
Burnished gold eyes blink against the storm’s bitter wind.
      “When you are in the salt, you feel like every gale is the world ender.
Every wave the greatest that has been. These boys ride the gales in rapture
at their own glory. But every now and then, a true storm rises. It shatters
their masts and rips their hair from their heads. They do not last long till the
sea swallows them whole. But their mothers have wept their deaths long
before, as I wept for yours the first day we met.”
      He stares at me intensely, mouth pinched behind his thick beard.
      “I never told you, but I was not raised in a palace or in a city like many
of the Peerless you know. My father thought there to be two evils in the
world. Technology and culture. He was a hard man. A killer, like the rest of
them. But his hardness was found not in what he could do, but in what he
wouldn’t do, in his restraint. In the pleasures he denied himself, and his
sons. He lived to a hundred and sixty-three without the help of cell
rejuvenation. Somehow he lived through eight Iron Rains. But still he never
valued life, because he took it too often. He was not a man to be happy.”
       I watch the former Rage Knight, Lorn au Arcos, lean over the balcony
of his castle. It is a limestone fortress set amidst a sea ninety kilometers
deep. Modern lines shape the place. It is not medieval, but a meld of past
and present—glass and steel making hard angles with the stone island—so
like the man I respect above all other Golds of his generation.
       Like him, this castle is a harsh place when the storms come. But when
the storms fade, sunshine will bathe this place, shinning through her glass
walls, glinting off her steel supports. Children will run its ten-kilometer
length, through its gardens, along its walls, down to the harbor. Wind will
tickle their hair, and all that Lorn will hear from his library is the crying of
gulls, the crash of the sea, and the laughter of his grandchildren and their
mothers, whom he guards in place of his dead sons. The only one missing is
little Lysander.
       If all Golds were like him, Reds would still toil beneath the Earth, but
he would have them know their purpose. It doesn’t make him good, but it
makes him true.
       He’s thick and broad and shorter than I. He lets his empty whiskey
tumbler go and permits the wind to swoop it sideways. It falls and the sea
swallows it whole. “They say you can hear the dead stormsons whooping in
the wind,” he mutters. “I say it’s the crying of their mothers.”
       “Storms of court have a way of drawing people back in,” I say.
       He laughs a derisive laugh, one that scorns the idea that I would know
anything about the storms of court, anything about the winds that blow.
       I came to him in secret, flying with a single ship, my five-kilometer
destroyer Pax. I told my master he would not help us. But I held on to hope
he would want to help me. Yet now that I see Lorn au Arcos again in the
knotted flesh, I’m reminded of the nature of the man and I worry. He knows
my captains and lieutenants are listening through the com unit in my ear. I
paid him respects and showed it to him so that he would not assume our
conversation to be a private one.
       “After more than a century of living, my body does not yet betray me.”
One would think him to be in his mid-sixties, at first glance. Only his scars
truly age him. The one on his neck, like a smile, was given to him four
decades ago by a Stained in the Moon Kings’ Rebellion, when the
Governors of Jupiter’s moons thought to make their own kingdoms after
Octavia deposed her father as Sovereign. The one that claims part of his
nose came from the Ash Lord, when they dueled as youths. “You’ve heard
the expression ‘The duty of the son is the glory of the father’?”
      “I have said it myself.”
      He grunts. “I have lived it. I have lost many for my own glory. I have
set my ship into the storm on purpose. Each time with women and children
in tow.” He lets the waves speak for a moment. They crash on the rocks and
then pull backward, slurping as they go, drawing things to the sea they call
Discordia.
      “It is not right to live so long, I think. My great-granddaughter was
born last night. I still have the smell of blood on my fingers.” He holds
them out—like tree roots, crooked and calloused from the holding of
weapons. They tremble slightly. “These took her from the darkness to the
light, from warmth to the cold, and cut the cord themselves. It would be a
fine world if that was the last flesh they cut.”
      He relaxes his hands and sets them on the cold stone. I wonder what
Mustang would say to this man. Seeing them face-to-face would be like
watching fire trying to catch on stone. She balked at my plan in public, but
then again, that was all our design. Plans within plans within plans.
      “To think about what hands feel,” Lorn mutters. “These have felt the
lifeblood of three strong sons as their hearts pumped it out of their bodies.
They’ve felt the cold of a razor’s hilt as they stole the dreams of youth.
They’ve worn the love of a girl and a woman and then felt those heartbeats
fade to silence. All for my glory. All because I chose to ride the sea. All
because I am strong and do not die easily as most.” He frowns. “Hands, I
think, were not meant to feel so much.”
      “Mine have felt more than I’d wish,” I say. I feel the snap go through
them that I felt at Eo’s hanging. The texture of her hair. I remember the
warmth of Pax’s blood. The chill of Lea’s pale face in the cold morning
after Antonia butchered her. The grainy red smear of haemanthus blossom.
Mustang’s bare hip as we lay by the fire.
      “You are young still. When you’re white-haired, you’ll have felt even
more.”
      “Some men don’t grow old.” No Helldiver does.
      “No. Some don’t.” He pokes Augustus’s lion’s badge on my dark
uniform. “And lions do not live so long as griffins. We can fly away from
things, you see.” He brandishes his own family ring and flaps his arms
foolishly, drawing a smile from me. He wears it along with his House Mars
ring. “You were a pegasus once, were you not?”
      “It was the symbol … is the symbol of Andromedus.” My false Gold
family. But the symbol reminds me of Eo. She pointed out the Andromeda
Galaxy to me before she died. It means so much and so little all at once.
      “There’s honor in staying what you were,” he says.
      “Sometimes we have to change. Not all of us are born rich as you.”
      “Let us go find Icarus in the forest.” He mentioned him often on Mars,
but I’ve never seen Lorn’s favorite pet. “Carolina conspired with Vincent to
make him a new toy. I think you’ll appreciate it.”
      “Where are your children?”
      “East wing till you leave.”
      “I’m that dangerous?”
      He does not answer.
      I follow my friend in off the balcony just as one of Europa’s clouds
spits blue lightning across the dark sky. Her oceans buck and heave as great
swells of water slither and seep along the white walls, as if the world of
oceans conspired to swallow the man-made island. Despite all this, the
castle and the raging storm still seem so small when I see how Jupiter
consumes the night sky behind the clouds—a textured gas giant staring
down at us like the head of some great marble god.
      As we walk through the stone villa, Lorn happily greets every servant
we pass. He sees people, not Colors. Most have been with him for years. I
should have studied with him. But then I would have ended up here, a better
man, but unable to change anything so far removed from the center of the
system.
      Children’s toys litter the halls. His family is here—dozens of loved
ones he brought together after he left public life. Most live scattered in the
southern archipelagos in the warmer waters near the equator. Hurricanes
forced them north this month to take refuge with Grandfather Lorn. Seems
like the storm followed them.
      He pushes open a grand glass gate, leading me into the center of his
citadel. Here, he keeps himself a forest, one several acres large and open to
the air. The walls stretch around the forest, closing it off from the vicious
waves. Lorn’s standards whip high in the air—a roaring purple griffin on a
field of snow white. Rain falls on the trees, hissing into their needles until
he activates a pulseBubble. Then the rain sizzles on its roof and folds up in
thick clouds of vapor. He walks ahead of me, and I linger back, taking small
black spikes no longer than my fingernails from a hidden pouch in my
sleeve. I scatter them through the moss just outside the door.
      “You came to me in a stolen vessel of war asking for my ships and my
men. Why?” Lorn asks, looking back curiously. I speed up my gait and drop
a few more when he turns again. I’m waiting for him to mention Lysander.
      “Because half of Mars is still held by forces loyal to the Bellona and
the Sovereign. To free Mars from them, we need your ships and your men.
Once we have them, the Moon Lords and the ArchGovernors of the Rim
will come to our aid against the Core.”
      “So you need me to aid you in your treason?”
      “Is it treason for a dog to bite its master’s hand when the master tries
to kill it?” I ask.
      “Terrible metaphor.” He stops, peers around the forest, searching.
“Ah.” We set off again.
      “The point is: I need your help.”
      He spits on the mossy ground and motions me to follow him up a
hillside. My boots crack a water-sodden log. “Why should I care about
you?”
      “Because you trained me.”
      “I also trained Aja au Grimmus.”
      “For some reason, I think you like me more than her.”
      “And why’s that?”
      “I have a sense of humor.”
      He laughs. “Aja can be funny.”
      “Surely you’re joking.”
      “You meet a man, you know him. You meet a woman, she knows
you.” He laughs to himself about some memory. “Might be easier thinking
her some terror in the night. But she’s flesh and blood. She has friends. She
has family. And she thinks you a threat to them.”
      “Yet she’s the one who killed my friend.”
      “Yes. I heard. You had the child. Clever tactic.” He squints back at the
razor curled around my arm. “Does everyone wear their razor like a fool
now?”
      “It’s the fashion.”
      “It’s meant to be looped on the hip. You’ll cut your arm off by
accident.” He sighs. “Your generation … So arrogant. Changing things for
no reason. I wonder, arrogant boy, did you think that if you rode in here
with your stolen ship that I, a man of a century, would follow you to battle?
That I would put in danger all my servants, all my family, all I love, for
you? Someone who rejected me when I asked him to join my house?”
      I ignore his bitterness. “You left the Society for a reason, Lorn. Can
you remember why?”
      “To avoid loud fools.”
      “I think you left because you thought the Society sick. Because it was
not worth sacrificing for anymore.”
      “Stop barking at me, puppy.”
      “So I’m right.”
      “No. You’re not right.” He wheels angrily on me. “I left the Society
not because it is sick, but because it is dead. The Society was created to
instill order. Men were made to sacrifice so that humanity endured. They
were given Colors, lives limited and ordered so that we could destroy the
timeless cycle of our race—prosperity to greed to war. Gold was meant to
shepherd the other Colors, not devour them. Now we are trapped again in
that cycle, the very thing we endeavored to avoid. So the Society? The
beautiful sum of all human enterprise? It been dead and rotting for hundreds
of years, and those who fight over it are but vultures and maggots.”
      “So it wasn’t Brutus’s death.” I speak of his youngest son who was
married to Octavia au Lune’s deceased daughter.
      “That was an accident.”
      “A convenient accident,” I say. “There are rumors that Octavia’s
daughter was organizing a coup against her mother.”
      “I don’t entertain rumors,” he says darkly.
      “If you help me, I can give you your grandson back.”
      “Lysander has been raised with poison in his ear. He is not my kin.”
      “You’re not that cold. Lorn, I’ve met the boy. He’s more like you than
her. He isn’t wicked. Fight for him.”
      Lorn stares quietly at the rain falling against the pulseShield.
      “You fight a tyrant to replace her with a tyrant,” he says wearily. “This
is the same game I have seen a hundred times. Do you even know who you
serve?”
      “I have a feeling you’re about to tell me.”
      “I’ll not stop being your teacher just because you’ve stopped listening.
Sit. I don’t want Icarus to be bothered by this damn story.” He sits on a
large stone and instructs me to take a place opposite him. I do. He hunches
forward and plays with the thick House Mars ring on his finger.
      “House Augustus was always strong, I’m sure you know that. Even
when Mars was little more than a mine for helium-3. They bribed or killed
their way into owning most of the governmental contracts. And as their
pockets swelled, so did their influence. They became, along with several
other families—including the Bellona and my own—the lords of Mars.
There was one family of greater power, however, named Cylus. They
controlled the ArchGovernorship and were favored by the Senate and the
sitting Sovereigns.
      “When your master, then simply called Nero, was seven, his father
found himself in dispute with Julius au Bellona. Nero’s father attempted to
have the Browns who served the Bellona poison the entire family at supper.
The plan failed. A housewar began.
      “Nero’s father summoned his bannermen and led them against the
Bellona and the ArchGovernor Cylus, who had declared his forces for
Julius au Bellona. The sitting Sovereign did not intervene, and instead
allowed the two families to go to war. Eventually, Nero’s father found
himself besieged in Agea when his fleet was destroyed and captured around
Phobos.
      “Cylus put Nero’s father to death. Only young Nero was spared from
the punishment visited on House Augustus. He was spared so that an aged
family that had partaken in the Conquering did not disappear from history.
It is said that ArchGovernor Cylus even gave young Nero grapes to quench
his thirst because there was no water as the city burned around them. After
that, he raised him in his own court.
      “Twenty years later, Nero, who had always been considered an
honorable and honest man, much unlike his wicked father, asked for Iona au
Bellona’s hand in marriage. She was the youngest and favorite daughter of
old Julius.”
      He stares up at water droplets falling from the needles of overhanging
evergreens. “I knew her well. My sons were her playmates. And I knew
Nero too. I liked him, even if he was a little cold as a child.
      “With hopes of mending the lingering wounds of past generations and
making Mars strong and unified, ArchGovernor Cylus agreed. Bellona
married Augustus.
     “It was a beautiful wedding. I was there representing the Sovereign as
the Rage Knight. And I had a wonderful time of it. I’d never seen Iona so
happy as she was in that stern young man’s arms. But that night, when the
Bellona family returned to their estate with the rest of their family, a
package arrived. Inside, old Julius found his daughter’s head. Grapes
stuffed in Iona’s mouth along with two wedding rings.
     “He summoned his daughters and sons, including Cassius’s father, and
flew to the Citadel to ask for justice from ArchGovernor Cylus, as he had
twenty years prior when the Augustuses first rose up.
     “But instead of his old friend, he found young Nero on the
ArchGovernor’s throne, backed by Praetorians and two Olympic Knights. I
was amongst them, having been told that Cylus was a threat to the Society
by my Sovereign. I did as I was commanded. The House of Cylus was
wiped out and stricken from record.
     “I found out later, Nero contrived an agreement with the daughter of
the sitting Sovereign. You know her as Octavia au Lune. Younger then, she
convinced her father to give Nero the throne of Mars and his revenge; in
return, she earned Nero’s support when she led the faction that overthrew
and killed her father five years later. That is the man you started a war for.”
     “I didn’t know this,” I say quietly.
     “History is written by the victors.”
     Lorn looks at me and the lines on his face seem to deepen. “I don’t
want to go to war, Darrow. In my time, I have seen a moon burn, because
one man would not bow. I have led a million warriors shot from warships to
invade a planet. You cannot begin to understand the horror of it. You think
only of how beautiful it will be. But they are men. They are women. They
have families. And they die by the thousands. And you will be helpless to
protect even the best of your friends.”
     “Ah!” He points uphill. “There’s Icarus.”
     Rain drips from the pines as we push through the lower tree boughs to
find Icarus, Lorn’s pet griffin, sleeping in a great bed of moss on a high
promontory inside the small forest. Icarus’s paws curl into his body. His
wings curve around him as he sleeps—iridescent and glittering with
droplets of water. His great eagle’s head is nearly larger than I, one of his
eyes half the size of my skull. The Carvers made him well.
     “He looks peaceful when he sleeps,” Lorn says.
      “He’s bigger than any I’ve seen,” I say, unable to conceal the awe in
my voice.
      “You’ve not been to the pole of Mars or Earth, then.”
      “Where did you buy him?”
      “Martian Carvers made him for my family. Damn that fashionable
Zanzibar twit. Icarus is of the same genus as the beasts in the high aeries in
Mars’s north pole. The ones they use to terrify Obsidians into believing
magic is real.” He strokes the sleeping giant. “Are you still in love with the
ArchGovernor’s daughter?” He glances back at me hopefully. “Is that why
you do this? I heard about her and the Bellona.”
      “It isn’t about what happened between her and Cassius.”
      “No?” he sighs. “I could have understood that, at least. You were
sloppy in that, you should know. The Winding Wisp would have done him in
three moves.”
      “I wasn’t sloppy. I was making a show.”
      “Sloppy. Violets are showmen. Did I train you to be a showman?”
      I move past him to pet Icarus. “So you do care about me.”
      He does not answer me for a spell, and it’s then that I know the
moment is nearly upon us. “In another life, you would have been one of my
sons, Darrow. I would have found you earlier, before whatever happened
that filled you with this rage. I would not have raised you to be a great man.
There is no peace for great men. I would have had you be a decent one. I
would have given you the quiet strength to grow old with the woman you
love. Now all I can give you is a chance. Icarus,” he booms.
      His griffin stirs by his side, its amber eye showing me my reflection.
The ground shudders as the creature moves, uprooting a tree as easily as I’d
pull a hair.
      I move back from the beast, unsure of Lorn’s intentions.
      “What is going on?” I ask Lorn.
      “Look to your ship.” He points upward in the night. Through a break
in the clouds, we can see my long ship glittering in orbit. She’s no longer
alone. Ten torchShips come for her now, slipping around the cover of
Europa’s equator to capture the Pax.
      “A Praetorian death squad waits for you inside my home, Darrow. Aja
au Grimmus leads them. They will take you, chain you, and bring you
before the Sovereign.”
      “You betrayed me?” I ask.
      “No. They arrived days ago. They threatened. What could I do? Kellan
au Bellona leads their fleet. It will destroy or capture your ship. I can’t stop
that. But I do not want you to die. So Icarus will take you to an island where
I have hidden a ship for you. Use it to escape.”
      “Will they hurt your family if I escape?”
      “They may try,” he growls. “That is the consequence of your decision
and mine.”
      He stands with his back to the sea.
      “I want to fade in peace. So please, leave and never return, Darrow.”
      He gestures to Icarus and I see a thin saddle upon the beast—the new
toy of which he spoke. But I do not need to flee. I shake my head for what
is about to happen.
      “I’m sorry, my friend. But I cannot allow that.”
      “Allow?” he asks, turning.
      “You will join us in this war.” My razor uncoils. “Whether you like it
or not.” I speak into my com, telling the Howlers to prepare to rise and the
Titans to bring the ships around.
      The blood drains from his face and he looks at the beast emblazoned
upon my tunic. “A lion after all.”
29
Old Man’s Wrath

      I prepared the trap before I even left the fleet. All secrets find
themselves whispered into Pliny’s ears and he would wish for nothing more
than my timely demise, particularly after I provoked him in the
ArchGovernor’s meeting. So he did his work. He schemed and plotted and
found himself an ally against the big bad Darrow au Andromedus in the
Sovereign herself, a fact that I will be happy to share with Augustus as soon
as possible.
      The Sovereign’s ships hid themselves amongst the ruins of a derelict
space station that was once used as a base of terraforming operations.
Kellan au Bellona was smart, but predictable. My larger secondary force—a
detachment of Telemanus ships—which I hid behind another smaller
moon’s mass, will ambush the Bellona force in sixty seconds, slingshotting
around the other side of the moon by using its gravity to gain velocity. With
Roque in command, I’ll have ten Bellona ships to add to my personal
armada by day’s end.
      “You knew,” Lorn accuses me quietly, his thick hand gripping my
uniform at the neck and shaking me. “You knew.” And he knows what this
means for him. It is not simply my victory. It is his defeat. One way or
another, he must ally himself. And I’ve made it easy for him to pick a side.
      “‘If you’re a fox, play the hare.’ Isn’t what you taught me? But it will
look like you knew I set a trap for her. That you slipped news of her trap to
me.” I touch his shoulder as he releases me. “I am sorry, friend. Truly. But
you are part of this war.”
      His jaw works, but he says nothing.
      “The Sovereign will send her Praetorians again to Europa once I have
left,” I say. “Only this time they’ll come for you and yours. Their black and
purple ships will shell you from orbit till your islands and your cities on the
archipelagos and mainland and the rising mountains in the south are made
glass and swallowed by the seas. The waters will weep over your shattered
towers, and of your house, there will be nothing but crypts in the deep.
Unless we win.”
      His eyes seek in me something to give him time. But instead he sees
only what made him take me under his wing from the start—himself. Most
men would give anything to see that, but here and now, he wishes to see
anything else.
      “I put my family at risk to help you escape. I took you in, taught you.
And you betray me like the others. Like Aja.”
      “You look for pity? You let me come here, Lorn. You would have
consigned my friends above to torture and death even as you gave me a
path to escape. But my friends will not be prisoners.”
      I point upward to the fiery gashes in the night sky as my secondary
force rockets around Europa.
      “Hate me, but fight at my side,” I tell Arcos. “Only then will your
family survive.” I put a hand out for my former teacher. He pulls out his
razor.
      “I should kill you.”
      “Can I come and shoot the geezer?” Sevro asks over the com.
      “Hold,” I tell him.
      “You forget.” Lorn pulls his own datapad from his pocket. “I could
have my fleet destroy yours, boy.”
      “Not before mine takes the Sovereign’s.”
      “But she would know then where House Arcos stands. She would
know that you tricked me. That my house is not part of this.”
      “Then do it,” I tell Lorn. “Launch your ships if you think my cause
evil. Put me down if you think me a monster.” I step forward close to him.
“But you know the heart that beats here. Choose me. Or choose that
darkness.” I nod down the hill of the forest garden to where we entered the
place. Twelve Obsidian Praetorians file through the same glass door we
used. Huge men and women in black and purple armor, skull helms. Only
one Stained—this one thinner than the others, like a winter asp standing on
its tail. His armor is white and splashed with colors like blood.
      They are less than fifty meters away. With them, shorter than the rest,
but more glorious, is the Protean Knight in her golden gear. Her razor
shimmers with the colors of a nebula, and her armor writhes like the waves
that batter the white walls of Lorn’s island. Aja peers up to the night sky,
where she sees my ambush unfolding. She lets her helmet recoil into her
armor.
      “And then the traitors were two,” she calls. “House Arcos has
embraced treason as well. Lorn. You stand with the lions?”
      “The House Arcos stands apart,” Lorn calls back.
      “Apart?” Quinn’s killer frowns and tilts her head so I can see the
dueling scars on the right of her neck. Her cat eyes scan the woods for signs
of a trap. “There is no such thing.”
      “I was as deceived as you, Aja!” Lorn calls. “Darrow knew you were
here. I don’t know how. But I am not your enemy. I want only to be left
alone.”
      “That was never a choice!” Aja calls. “You know this better than
anyone. You are with us or you are against us, Lorn.”
      “Aja. No. I have no part in this! None!”
      “The strong always have a part,” I mutter.
      “I will not have my hand forced.” He cuts me with an angry stare. “I
have no quarrel with either of you. I am a man of peace now.”
      “Then why is your blade out?” Aja smiles. “Do what you know. Come
down and speak, teacher. We should not shout! Isn’t that what you said
when I used to raise my voice in anger?” She eyes the griffin that now
growls beside us. It’s larger than four horses. I wonder what those talons
would do against their armor.
      “Her ships are lost,” I whisper to Lorn. “What would Octavia have her
do?”
      “Kill us. For spite.”
      I lower my voice. “Then you have no choice.”
      “So it would seem.”
      Aja watches me kneel to the ground and gather dirt in my hand. She
has studied me. She knows what this must mean. And she must wonder
what plan I have. Why I’ve come alone. If I really set an ambush in the sky,
wouldn’t I set one below? I’m about to shout something to her when
another figure steps through the gate to join Aja. He’s rangy. Darker skin
than mine. A smirk on his bored, patrician face. Tactus. All in Praetorian
armor. He slinks forward, a shadow of purple and black, eyeing the sky
apprehensively before beaming me a lopsided smile.
      “Speaking of traitors,” I shout. “Hello, Tactus. Pretty armor.”
      “Reaper, my goodman!” Tactus bellows, and throws up the crux.
“Where’s Sevro?” He leans in to tell Aja something. Aja straightens and
looks again to the trees around. Her men condense in defensive formation.
Tactus warns them of my tricks. They know something is awry. Their aegis
shields activate, glittering over arms.
      Lorn closes his eyes and lets his left hand into the air, feeling the
whipping of the storm’s wind. “Leave Aja to me. You’ll have better luck
against the Stained.”
      “No. They’re all mine. Sevro, rise.”
      The Howlers emerge from the sea beyond the castle. Water drips from
them as they fly silently over the hundred-meter-high walls, armor
glistening like black beetle shells. A golden lion has been painted on each
breastplate. The gold winks as lightning flashes. They land silently around
us.
      “My stormsons,” I say to Lorn. Twenty new recruits have come from
the families of the Howlers and the Telemanus ranks. Sevro held tryouts. I
hear it was a bloody bit of fun. Snakes, alcohol and mushrooms were
involved. That’s all they let me know.
      “Goblin! Why are you always hiding?” Tactus calls. His voice is all
jest, but he looks to the sky anxiously again. “Least it’s better than a horse’s
belly this time.”
      Sevro pulls out his skinning knife, the one he used to take scalps with
Harpy years ago. It’s a curved customer. He taps it on his groin and points
to Tactus. His eyes flick to Aja.
      “You killed a Howler, Aja,” he says. “Wrong play.”
      As I expected, the appearance of the Howlers reassures Aja and
Tactus. This makes sense to them: I had soldiers hidden. Now I do not. A
battle to the death. Honor. Pride. One force against another. The Obsidian
Praetorians begin to keen their terrible throat song. All those men want is
the glorious end. To join their relatives in the laughing halls of Valhalla with
their blades in hand. They step forward on Aja’s command. The deadliest
men and women in the Solar System, a Stained amongst them.
      And I take a page from Evey’s book.
      Ensuring Aja is clear, I detonate the landmine spikes I dropped on the
ground as Lorn and I strolled into this forest. Only Tactus is quick enough.
He grabs Aja from behind and jerks her back, hard—so hard in the lowGrav
that both of them tumble in through the door just as the first explosion rips
the salt air.
      The explosions are tiered. First comes a concussion that disables
pulseShields and scatters the Praetorians into the air. Then comes a gravPit,
which pulls them back toward the source of the explosion like a vacuum
collecting flies; and then comes the third—pure kinetics to destroy armor
and bone and flesh, blowing the warriors outward, into the air, scattering
their pieces in the low gravity like breath scatters the seeds of a dandelion.
Limbs float gently down. Blood beads and spatters the ground. The
explosion breaks the bubble roof overhead and rain again drifts down on the
garden to extinguish the fires and thin the blood that leaks into the two
dozen bomb craters. Only three Praetorians survived. They’re in poor
shape.
      “Do not let her escape.” Roque’s voice sears my ears. He watches my
holofeed from the ships above.
      My Howlers have not yet moved.
      Lorn’s furious with me, saying something about honor.
      “What?” I sneer. “You think I fight fair?”
      “Darrow …,” Sevro hisses as I wait. “Darrow …”
      “Hold.”
      “She’s getting away!” Roque’s voice frightens me. It drips with spite I
didn’t know he had. “Darrow!”
      I growl at him to pay attention to his part of the battle.
      “Darrow …,” Sevro begs. “Long enough.”
      Lorn watches, perhaps beginning to understand.
      I snap my fingers. “Hunt.”
      The Howlers surge forward like loosed wolves to finish what the bomb
started. They dispatch the remaining Praetorians. Sevro shouts Tactus’s
name amidst the howling as they tear into the castle searching for him and
Aja.
      “Darrow, what are you playing at?” Roque asks me over the com. I let
the holo of his face appear in the corner of my helmet’s HUD display. His
jaw muscles flicker. “If Quinn’s killer escapes …”
      “Lock that up,” I tell Roque as I see reports of one of our torchShips
taking massive damage. He’s distracted. “Men are dying up there. Focus on
your own job.” I shut off the link.
      Harpy’s image appears on my display. “Seahorse is under.”
      “Good. And Tactus?”
      “No sign.”
      “Copy.” I close the connection.
     “Aja spooked into he sea. But no sign of Tactus,” Sevro says to me
several minutes later as the Howlers scour the inside of the castle, going
room to room. “He’s hiding. Unless he’s teleported.” He spits at that bit of
science fiction. “Ask the geezer where they are.”
     A dark worry slithers into my brain. I turn to Lorn. “What would Lune
have them do if they could not kill you and me? If she thought someone
expendable, what would she order them to do?”
     He stands there for a moment in the rain. Then his face goes pale. “The
children …” Arcos pushes past me, running through the bomb’s carnage to
the shattered glass door. “They’re going to kill my grandchildren!” he
shouts back.
     “Where are the children?” I ask Sevro.
     “What children? We found none.”
     Cursing, I chase Arcos.
     “I hid them,” he says over his shoulder to me as he sprints down the
castle’s hall. He’s fast for an old man, but the gravity slows us till we start
using our hands on the walls and ceiling, using gravBoots to take the long
halls. We launch around corner after corner. And when he touches the head
of a stone griffin and a steel wall falls away to reveal a hidden passage, I
smell blood. Two corpses lie on the other side of the passage. One Gray,
one Obsidian. I push past Arcos and fly ahead. I pull myself down a series
of stairs using handholds in the ceiling till I find myself before two doors. I
open one. Just a storeroom. I open another and let my razor slither into
hand.
     “Tactus,” I say slowly.
     His back is to me. Three bodies lie around him, their blood making a
pool about his shoes. His razor coils in his hand, hardening as he stands
with his head lowered in a room of children and women. Blood slithers
down the mercurial blade. He killed two men and a woman. Obsidians.
     When I came, Arcos hid the children from me here, some Gold, some
Silver, some Pink and Brown. Tactus could kill half of them with a lazy
swing of his razor before we reach them.
     “Tactus, remember your brothers,” I say to him, looking at the
children.
     “My brothers are shits.” He laughs coarsely, voice sounding strange.
“Said I should get out of your shadow. Mother calls me the Mighty Servant.
Did you know that?”
      Children sob in the corner. One buries her face in her mother’s lap.
The women are not armed. These are not warriors like Victra and Mustang.
A Brown nursemaid covers a Gold child’s eyes. I hear Arcos in the tunnel
behind me.
      “Lune’s orders are wrong,” I say to Tactus.
      “She asked me if I could fill your place, Reaper,” Tactus says quietly.
“Said she didn’t think I could. Said I was so long in your shadow that she
didn’t know if I would ever be more than an echo of you. I told her I could
do anything you could do.”
      “Tactus, she is evil.”
      “Is she?” He spits blood on the ground, still not facing me. “They say
the same thing about you. They wonder who you think you are to do what
you do. To challenge the men and women you challenge. They wonder what
right you have.”
      “We all have a right to challenge. That’s the point.”
      “The point. Was there a point?” he asks. “I was never told. You took
me for granted. Never telling me anything.” Just as I’m doing with Roque.
“Always whispering with others. Dismissing me like I’m a fool. You’re just
like her …”
      “Your mother?”
      He says nothing. Arcos edges in beside me. I put a hand out to stop
him.
      “Would you kill them, if Augustus told you to?” Tactus asks me,
turning slightly.
      “No,” I say. “I’d rather die.”
      “I didn’t think so. She was right. I am the Mighty Servant.”
      I open my hands to him. “I don’t know what I’m to do now, Tactus.”
      “That’s a first.” He laughs bitterly, voice slurring slightly.
      “Hardly. I didn’t know what to do when I whipped you,” I say. “At the
Institute. I didn’t want to lose you from my army because of your talents.
But I couldn’t not punish you.”
      “Talents. Talents. Talents. Then that’s the difference between us,”
Tactus’s voice thickens further. “Because if it had been my army, I would
have killed your arrogant ass.” He turns more and I see the hints of the ruin
the bomb’s made of his face.
      “You know what happens if you kill any of them?”
      He nods to me, then to the Rage Knight, as if saying it’ll be either one
or the other that does him. “I’m not sorry I took Lysander, you know.”
      “I don’t think you’re ever sorry for much.”
      “Not sorry.” He chuckles and dips a toe in the blood surrounding him.
“But I think I shouldn’t have done it. I was testing you at the Institute. But
… I wanted to see what you’d do. If you were worth following.”
      “Was I?”
      “You know that answer.”
      “Am I still?”
      He nods. “Always,” saying it so pathetically that it feels like my heart
has been pulled into my throat. He’s a traitor, a liar, a cheat. Yet I see a
friend. I want to fix him and make him whole. What am I doing? I have to
put him down. But I’ve done that before with Titus. That cycle erodes us.
Death begets death begets death, and ever more.
      “What if I let you live?” I ask suddenly, drawing a confused, frantic
glance from Tactus. Of course he doesn’t understand forgiveness. “What if I
let you come back?”
      “What?”
      “What if I forgave you?”
      “You’re lying.” He turns more and I see the full measure of what the
bomb did to him. His nose is crooked, broken. The rest looks like a cherry
stripped of its skin. My friend …
      “I’m not lying.” I did not put my faith in Tactus once, and I lost him.
Now I will. I’ll take the same leap I ask him to take. I step forward. “I know
there’s good in you. I saw your face when those children were killed at the
gala. You’re not a monster. Come back to me. You would be one of my
lieutenants again, Tactus. I would give you a legion to lead when we take
Mars. You’ll carry one of my standards. But you can’t wear that ugly
armor.”
      “It is uncomfortable,” he wheezes with a slight smile. “But Sevro,
Roque, Victra …”
      “They miss you,” I lie. “Drop your razor and come back to my army. I
promise you will be safe.” The razor dips in his hand. One of the children
spares a smile at his younger siblings, a hopeful smile. “Just leave the
children alone, and all is forgiven.”
      I mean it. Deep in my heart, I mean it.
      “We all make mistakes,” he says.
      “We all make mistakes. Just come back. I won’t hurt you.” I drop my
own razor. “Neither will Arcos.” I stare at Arcos till he nods his weathered
head in complicity.
      “I want to come home,” Tactus murmurs quietly, pain in his voice. “I
want to come home.”
      “Then come home.”
      Tactus’s razor clatters to the floor and he falls to a knee in front of me.
He’s rasping from pain. Relief floods the room. The children start crying
again from the tortuous shift from death to life. The caretakers hug their
charges, their tears making lines on their faces. I go forward to Tactus and
motion him upward to clasp my arm. He wraps me in a frantic hug and sobs
into me. Body shaking, bloody features painting my armor.
      “I’m sorry,” he says a dozen times. He’s weeping hard into my
shoulder, clasping tight. His face is such a ruin. And I hug him. Exhaustion
fills me. His sadness is like a weight that nearly drives me to tears. Yet I’m
buoyed by the strange feelings of having him back, standing with me,
gripping me. It is a humbling thing knowing someone cannot live without
you, knowing that though they’ve betrayed you, they wish for nothing but
absolution. And as he clenches my back, I wrap my arms around his armor
and try not to cry myself. Even the cruel feel pain. And even the cruel can
change. I hope this changes him. He could do so much, if only he would
learn.
      In so many ways, he is the embodiment of his race. And so if Tactus
can change, Gold can change. They must be broken, but then they must be
given a chance. I think that’s what Eo would have wanted in the end.
      When at last his sobs are done and we part, he stands at my side, loyal
as a puppy, looking to me subtly for signs of affection. His hands tremble
from the pain of his wounds, yet he watches in silence with Arcos and me
as the children, high and low alike, file upward out of the hidden bunker
with their caretakers. Pebble comes down to giddily tell us Roque is
wrapping up the space engagement. Seeing Tactus’s wounds, she pales. I
tell her to fetch a Yellow.
      Soon Lorn, Tactus, and I are left alone in the basement.
      Lorn looks over to us. “Now that the children are gone,
consequences.” His hands flash faster than a hummingbird’s wings. An
ionDagger appears, lurches forward four times into Tactus’s armpit, where
the armor is the weakest. I rush to stop Lorn, but it’s already done. He
twists like he’s wringing a towel, severing the artery, an old man killing a
young one. Tactus’s ruined face wrenches with pain; and he gasps, as
though he knew justice would finally find him in the end.
     Lorn leaves. And I hold my friend as he dies, his eyes fading to some
distant place, where perhaps he’ll find that peace Roque always wished for
him.
30
Gathering Storm

      “How long till we reach the rendezvous?” I ask Orion on the command
deck. Except for our attendants, we are alone in front of the viewports of
the Pax, watching my ships cross through space. The newest additions to
our fledgling armada are painted white and carry Lorn’s angry-faced purple
griffin. With them fly the black and blue and silver warships captured from
Kellan au Bellona above Europa. Oranges and Reds crawl over the exteriors
of the metal monsters, mending the holes made by leechCraft and preparing
them for the siege of Mars.
      “Three days till Hildas Station. The other ships will have beaten us
there, dominus.”
      Kavax and Daxo approach from behind. I turn to them and gesture out
the repaired windows to the ten ships of Kellan au Bellona.
      “Thank you for the presents,” I say.
      “Your plan, your spoils,” Kavax declares.
      “With us taking a percentage, naturally,” Daxo adds, smooth as ever,
raising his swirling golden eyebrows. “Fifty percent finder’s fee.” I glance
at him with amusement. “Well, thirty percent, because Pax liked you.”
      “Ten percent!” Kavax booms.
      I cock my head. “You’re a poor negotiator, Praetor.”
      He shrugs amiably and points in joy to jelly beans on the ground. He
tosses Sophocles at them, encouraging him to vanquish them all.
      “Twenty.” Daxo splays his hands, his movements always seeming to
belong to a thinner, more bookish man. “That is fair, no? We lost a hundred
and sixty house Grays and thirteen Obsidians.”
      “Then thirty percent to compensate you. For friends.”
      “Three ships! What a haggle!” Kavax proclaims. “What a haggle.
Sometimes a man needs a good haggle.” He claps me on the back, making
the joints crack again. “If only we had caught Aja. That’d be a spoil to
divide!”
      “She fled into the sea, unfortunately.” I gesture to Ragnar, who stands
at the edge of the bridge. “Heard he did well.” Pale and tall, he continues
looking at me from behind his beard and runic tattoos, appearing as devoid
of emotions as Kavax and Daxo are full of them.
      “The leader of his boarding party got killed. So did the lieutenants.
Lots of heads smashed. They ran into some of Kellan’s friends,” Kavax
says dourly as he rummages through his pockets for his impatient fox, who
clawed at his leg for more jelly beans. “I don’t have any more, my little
prince.” He smiles up at me hopefully. “Do you have any jelly beans?”
      “No. Sorry.”
      “Ragnar there took command. Did himself well,” Daxo says.
      “Took command?” I ask.
      Kavax explains. “There was a kill squad of Peerless. Half a dozen
Bellona blade dancers, real noble boys, carved up all our Golds and most of
the Obsidians. The Stained there collected the surviving Grays and a few
Obsidians and managed to get the ship.”
      “Any of these blade dancers survive?”
      “No.”
      Ragnar looks at the ground again, as if expecting a reprimand.
      “Well done, my goodman,” I say instead.
      Both Kavax and Daxo squint at the familiarity.
      Worth it to see Ragnar surprise me with a smile. A broad, yellow-
toothed grin.
      “Do you think he could do more?” I ask.
      Daxo hesitates. “What do you mean?”
      “Could he lead absent a Gold?”
      Daxo and Kavax share a worried glance. “What would be the benefit
in that?” Daxo asks.
      “I could send him places I could not send Golds.”
      “There is no such place.” Kavax crosses his arms. I go too far.
      I smile to placate them. “Of course. Just a theory. The mind wanders
from time to time.” I clap Kavax on the shoulder and they depart together
for their own ship.
      “You overstepped,” Orion says.
      “I beg your pardon?”
      “You have ears.”
      I look down, searching the pale blue tattoos on her dark skin as if the
math there held the key to understanding her mind. “You’re observant for a
Blue.”
     “Because I know how the world works outside my digital sync?
Comes from working the docks, dominus. When you’re at the bottom, you
have to notice everything.”
     “Which docks?” I ask.
     “Phobos. Father was a Docker, born outside the Sects. Died when I
was small. A young girl has to be on her toes if she wants to grow big in the
Hive dock cities. It’s the only way to beat the monsters.”
     “It’s not the only way,” I say.
     “No?” she asks, surprised.
     “You can always become a monster too.”
     Orion turns from the viewport to look up at me. Fierce intelligence
burns behind her arctic eyes. “And there’s the beauty of space. A billion
paths to choose.”
     I’m spared from replying when the comBlue calls from the pit.
     “Dominus, we’ve an assault shuttle inbound. It’s Virginia au
Augustus.”
31
Coup

     “Father is captured,” she says to me as she storms down the ramp from
her smoking ship. She’s flanked by several Obsidian bodyguards in battle-
scarred armor. A dozen Grays exit the shuttle behind them. Sun-hwa from
Luna amongst them. They’re all lurcher mercenaries, plain and dangerous.
The Jackal’s hunters. They salute smartly.
     Around us, hundreds of ripWings and a dozen storks sit parked the bay
—large enough a place to swallow all of Lykos’s Common and her
townships. Oranges and Greens clamor about the craft, preparing
maintenance checks before the eventual invasion of Mars.
     I greet Mustang with my own coterie—Lorn, Sevro, the Howlers,
Victra, and Ragnar. Roque did not respond to my summons. I want to rush
forward to embrace Mustang, but she’s in a rage. Spittle flying out of her
mouth. Dark circles ringing angry eyes. Exhaustion pulls at her face.
     “Pliny has begun a coup. He arrested my brother. My aunt is dead, and
her children murdered along with six of our Praetors. More than twenty of
my father’s bannermen have sworn new oaths of fealty. And we’ve lost
control of the fleet.”
     I ask Mustang if she’s injured.
     “Injured?” She sneers the word. “As if that could matter. They killed
my men. We came upon the Academy in stealth, and as soon as I launched
my leechCraft toward the space station and the training ships, a Bellona
fleet emerged from behind an asteroid and destroyed every one of my
leechCraft. Ten thousand men. Dead. They didn’t have to do it. They had
enough guns on us that we could do nothing but surrender. It was
merciless.”
     “Sounds like Karnus,” I guess.
     She nods. “And Pliny. They didn’t lead the Bellona on a goose chase.
They led them straight into my operation.”
     “Why didn’t Pliny just kill you?” Sevro asks.
     “A man like Pliny craves legitimacy,” Lorn says from my side,
nodding in greeting to Mustang. If she thinks his presence here strange, she
doesn’t let on. “It’s his nature. He came to you beforehand, didn’t he?”
      Mustang shares a disgusted look with my mentor.
      “The Pixie had me put under guard in my quarters as he took my
captured fleet to Hildas. During the journey, he came to me and showed me
the holo footage of my father’s failed raid on Ganymede.” She shudders in
anger. “And he said that though my house had fallen to ruin, he would not
see my bloodline ended. The Sovereign and he had come to an
arrangement. If he could provide her with peace, then she would provide
him with position, legitimacy, and a prize of his choosing. So he batted his
pretty lashes at me as my father’s ships burned on the holo and said he
would divorce his wife and allow me the honor of taking his hand in
marriage.”
      I say nothing. The Howlers rumble discontentedly.
      “And your response?” Victra asks.
      Mustang ignores her. “He said he always had his eye on me.” She
reaches into her pocket, pulls something out, and drops it onto the floor. “So
I took one of his.”
      Sevro cackles with Harpy. Lorn makes a sound of disapproval. Like he
has any ground to stand on in matters of cruelty.
      “It is good to see you again, Rage Knight,” Mustang says. “I’m sorry
you were drawn into this. But we need you now more than ever.”
      “I’m beginning to see that.”
      “Where’s your brother?” I ask Mustang, looking up from the eye.
      “Captured. There’s more that should be said.” She glances at the
Oranges and the Grays in the hangar. “In private.”
      “Of course. We’ll continue in the warroom—” I begin.
      “In due time, Darrow.” Grandfatherly concern spreads across Lorn’s
face as he turns to Mustang. “My lady, you’ve been through a trial. Perhaps
you should find rest and we could—”
      The Howlers and I back away from Lorn.
      “Rest?” Mustang’s voice rises. “Why would I need rest?”
      “My mistake,” Lorn says politely.
      “Theodora,” I call. She slips forward. “Coffee, stims, and food in the
warroom. Enough for ten.” I remember the two Telemanuses. “Make it
twenty.”
      She laughs accidentally. “Yes, dominus.” She steps aside to call her
staff.
     Mustang jerks her head at her ship. “Just going to let it sit there?”
     “Chief!” I call to the Orange in charge of the hangar deck. Grease
stains his beard. He saunters up, wiping burly hands on his orange greasers.
“Put that ship out the airlock.”
     “It can be salvaged,” the Orange says.
     I look to Mustang. “Did you escape, or did they let you escape?”
     “I don’t know. My brother was the one who saved me. The Grays are
his mercenaries. His own ship was caught helping mine escape.”
     The Jackal is full of surprises.
     “What if there is a bomb in it?” Sevro asks, staring at the ship
uncomfortably.
     “It won’t be a bomb,” I say.
     “Pliny wants me still, and he wants Darrow for the Sovereign. But
more so, he wants your fleet, Darrow. When it didn’t show up at Hildas, he
must have realized that you’d been warned or that you were waiting for a
code confirmation that he didn’t know.”
     “And he figured if anyone would know where I was, it’d be you.”
     “So tracking me is how he will find this fleet,” Mustang says.
     Lorn looks back and forth at us. “When did you two discuss this?”
     “Just now,” Mustang says, confused at the question.
     Sevro claps Lorn on the shoulder. “Don’t worry. You’re not senile.
They’re just odd.”
     Lorn stares at Sevro’s dirty hand. The fingerless glove is covered with
mashed potatoes and brown gravy. Sevro’s broad smile fades and he
sheepishly withdraws his hand.
     I turn back to the Orange. “Put it out the airlock. Fastlike.” He seems
hesitant. Keeps rolling onto the balls of his feet. “Unless you’ve a better
idea?”
     He scratches his head, looking worried with all the Gold faces staring
at him. The deckhands watch the exchange furtively.
     “Out with it,” Sevro barks.
     “Sure. Well, I could put it out the lock, dominus. Or, I mean, I could
find the scanners and the radiated material, if they went that route. We got
some clever nuts and bolts here. Could find ’em out, and I could put ’em all
in a long-range scout, no problem. Might do nice to let Pliny’s hounds go
barking in the wrong direction, yeah?”
     “What is your name and world?” I ask.
      “Dominus … uh.” He blinks heavily. “Cyther’s my name. Luna. Three
girls. Wife works in the Center for Automotive Development, so we have
—”
      I cut him off. “Do this right and we’ll bring them to Mars and put them
up on the Citadel staff, Cyther. You have ten minutes.”
      He wheels to his men excitedly.
      I lead Mustang and my coterie to the lifts.
      “Pliny said he killed you,” she whispers as we walk.
      “Aja and a Bellona fleet waited for us, like we thought they would.” I
grin sideways at her, then pull up my datapad. “Orion, take command of the
fleet. I want us far from this sector before we have more company. Sevro,
summon the Telemanuses. I want them in the … Sevro?” I look around for
him. He’s loitering around Pliny’s eyeball some twenty meters back. We
turn to look at him and he shuffles his feet awkwardly.
      “Can I …” He gestures to it.
      “What?” Mustang asks.
      “Can I have it?”
      Mustang squints at him. “Oh! Uh. All yours.”
      He scoops it up and jams it in his pocket, grinning merrily. He runs to
catch up. “Collecting the set, hopefully.”
32
Die Young

      Mustang insisted on seeing Tactus before the meeting. Theodora
guides us. We find Roque sitting by his body in the ship’s medBay. The way
he sits with his hands clasped together, you’d think Tactus might still have a
chance at life. Perhaps in some other world where men like Lorn don’t
exist.
      “He’s been here since Europa,” Theodora says quietly.
      “You didn’t tell me he was down here,” I say.
      “He asked me not to.”
      “You’re my servant, Theodora.”
      “And he’s your friend, dominus.”
      Mustang nudges me. “Stop being an ass, can’t you see she’s as
exhausted as he is?”
      I look at Theodora. Mustang’s right. “You should get some sleep,
Theodora.”
      “A prime idea, I think, dominus. Always lovely to see you, domina,”
Theodora says to Mustang before shooting me a cross look. “Master has
been rather moody in your absence.”
      Mustang watches Theodora glide out. “You were lucky with her.” She
gently touches Roque’s shoulder. His eyes flutter open.
      “Virginia.”
      They grew close in the year we all spent in the Citadel together.
Neither could ever get me to join them at the opera. It’s not that I wasn’t
interested in the music. Lorn simply demanded time.
      She squeezes his hand. “How are you?”
      “Better than Tactus.” He glances at me. I wager he’d say more if I
weren’t here. He sees Mustang’s state of disarray, brow creasing in worry.
“What went wrong?”
      Once we tell him, he gently runs a hand through his wavy hair. “Well,
that is bad. I never thought Pliny would ever be so thoroughly bold.”
      “We’re meeting in ten to discuss plans,” I say.
      Roque ignores me. “I’m sorry about your father and brother, Virginia.”
      “They’re still alive, I hope.” She looks to Tactus and her face quiets.
“I’m sorry about Tactus.”
      “He went as he lived,” Roque says. “Only wish he could have lived
longer.”
      “You think he would have changed?” Mustang asks.
      “He was always our friend,” Roque says. “It was our responsibility to
help him try. Even if it was like hugging a flame.” He looks at me
momentarily.
      “You know I didn’t want him to die,” I say. “I wanted him to come
back with us.”
      “Just as you wanted to catch Aja?” Roque says, snorting at my
expression.
      “I told you why I did that.”
      “Naturally. She kills our friend. She kills Quinn, but we let her walk
away for the grander scheme. Everything costs something, Darrow. Perhaps
you’ll soon tire of making your friends pay.”
      “That’s not fair,” Mustang says quickly. “You know it’s not.”
      “What I know is we’re running out of friends,” Roque replies. “Not all
of us are as tough as the Reaper. Not all of us want to be warriors.”
      Of course Roque thinks this life is a choice of mine. His own
childhood was one of leisure and reading, spent going back and forth
between his family estate in New Thebes and the highlands of Mars. His
parents didn’t believe in enhanced learning uploads, so they hired Violets
and Whites to teach him pedagogically—walking and talking in peaceful
pastures and beside still lakes.
      “Tactus didn’t sell the violin,” Roque says after a moment.
      “The one Darrow gave him?”
      “Yes. The Stratovarian. He sold it, then felt so guilty he didn’t let the
sale finalize with the auction house. Made them cancel the order. He was
practicing in private, shaking off some of the rust. Said he wanted to
surprise you with a sonata, Darrow.”
      The heaviness in me deepens. Tactus was always my friend. He just
got lost in trying to be the man his family wanted him to be, when all along
his friends loved the man he already was. Mustang puts a hand on my lower
back, knowing what I’m thinking. Roque leans down now to kiss Tactus
once on the cheek and to give him a benediction.
      “Better to go into that other world in the full glory of some passion
than to fade and wither with age. Live fast. Die young, my wayward
friend.”
      Roque walks away, leaving Mustang and me alone with Tactus.
      “You have to fix that,” she says of Roque. “Fix it before you’ve lost
him.”
      “I know,” I say. “Soon as I fix a hundred other things.”
      We sit in the warroom in full council around a grand wooden table.
Coffee cups and trays of food litter it. Mustang sits at my side, boots up on
the table, as ever, while she explains what went wrong with her father’s
mission. Kavax leans forward precariously in his seat, terrified at the idea
of Augustus suffering defeat. He wrings his hands nervously, so distressed
that Daxo takes Sophocles from his lap and hands her to an uncomfortable
Victra. Mustang’s voice fills the room and the holo Pliny gave her comes to
life above the table. A brigade of corvettes rockets silently through space
toward the famed shipyards of Ganymede that ring the industrial planet
mottled green, blue, and swirling white.
      “He dispatched a lurcher squad of Grays concealed in the belly of two
tankers. They disabled three of the defensive platform’s nuclear reactors.
Then my father came in hard with his ripWings and corvettes, as is his way
—burning engines and dropping munitions before curling back around.
      “It was a treasure trove—some seventeen destroyers and four
dreadnoughts in dry dock, most near or at completion. Supposing the ships
to be manned by skeleton crews, he boarded them simultaneously. He even
commanded the leechCraft that boarded the moonBreaker with his two
Stained. But the ships were not manned by skeleton crews. There were no
crews at all. Instead, they were loaded with Praetorians, Gray lurcher
squads. And Olympic Knights.”
      “And he … surrendered?” Kavax asks in panic.
      Mustang laughs. “My father? He nearly cut his way free. He killed the
Hearth Knight, then he ran into some of our old friends.”
      The holo shows Augustus flowing through twelve Grays, like a man
wading through stalks of high, dry grass. His razor sings and shrieks,
sparking against the walls, sliding through men and armor till he meets
another man in armor the shade of flame. The Hearth Knight. There’s a
flurry of tight lunges and then red mist. A head thumps to the ground. Then
two men appear. One in a sun-crested helm, the other Fitchner in his
wolfhead helm. Together, the men kill the Stained and put Augustus
bleeding on the ground.
      Lorn looks over at me. “Lady … Mustang, who was the man in the
sun-crested armor?”
      She’s silent.
      “That’s the armor of the Morning Knight,” I answer. “Cassius. They
must have mended his arm. Or given him a new one.”
      Mustang continues. “Julii ships were also there.” She looks at Victra.
“They finished my father’s forces off.”
      Sevro glares at Victra, taking Sophocles from her as though she
couldn’t even be trusted with the fox. “Do you feel awkward? You should.”
      “We’ve been over this,” Victra says, sounding quite bored with the
accusations. “My mother was threatened by the Sovereign. She’s not
political. She cares about money and little else.”
      “So she doesn’t care about loyalty?” Mustang asks. “Interesting.”
      “Pfah. Agrippina’s a wicked bitch,” Kavax grumbles. “Always has
been.”
      “Careful, large one,” Victra warns. “She’s still my mother.”
      Kavax crosses his burly arms. “Apologies. That she is your mother.”
      “And how do we know you’re not in collusion with them, Victra?”
Daxo asks softly. “Perhaps you spy? Perhaps you wait. How do you trust
her loyalty, Darrow? She could easily have sent word …”
      Mustang looks at me. “I was wondering that myself.”
      “Why do I trust you, Daxo, or you, Kavax?” I ask. “Either of you
would be in prime shape, earn pardons, earn more territories and monies if
you delivered my head to the Sovereign.”
      “And your heart to Cassius’s mother,” Sevro reminds me.
      “Thank you, Sevro.”
      “Here to help!” He grabs a drumstick off the table’s spread and feeds it
to Sophocles. Considering, he takes a bite himself, saying something quietly
to the fox.
      “I trust Victra for the same reason I trust any of you—friendship,” I
say, managing to look away from Sevro.
      “Friendship. Ha.” Mustang sets her coffee cup down loudly. “I’ll be
blunt. I don’t trust a Julii further than I could throw one.”
      “That’s because you’re intimidated by me, little girl.”
      Mustang sits up straighter. “‘Little’?”
      “I have a decade on you, darling. One day you’ll look back at yourself
and laugh. Was I really so foolish, so simple? Additionally, you’re not very
tall. So I’ll call you little.”
      “I don’t cat-fight,” Mustang says coldly. “I don’t trust you because I
don’t know you. All I know is your mother’s reputation is not apolitical.
She’s a schemer. A briber. My father knew it. I know it. You know it.”
      “Yes, to a degree my mother is a schemer. And so am I and so are you,
but if there’s one thing I am not, it is a liar. I’ve never told one, and never
will. Unlike some people.” The arch of eyebrows makes it quite clear what
she means.
      “Bad apples spawn bad seeds, Darrow,” Daxo warns. “Put your
feelings aside on this one. She was raised by a dangerous woman. There’s
no need to mistreat her, but we can’t have her in this council. I would
encourage you to place her in quarters till this is over.”
      “Yes.” Kavax raps the table with his knotted knuckles. “Agreed. Bad
seeds.”
      “I can’t believe you lured me into this mess, Darrow,” Lorn mutters.
He looks out of place here. Too old, too gray to be party to squabbling.
“Can’t even trust your own council.”
      “Grumpy. Low blood sugar perhaps?” Sevro tosses him the half-
gnawed drumstick. Lorn lets it flop against the table, unimpressed by the
display.
      “We would hear your wisdom, Arcos,” Kavax says respectfully.
      “I would listen to your councillors, Darrow.” Lorn pops his knotted
fingers. “I’ve got scars older than them, but they aren’t completely naïve.
Better safe than sorry. Confine Victra to her quarters.”
      “You don’t even know me, Arcos!” Victra protests, finally pulled out
of her chair. You see the warrior in her now, flaring just beneath the
cultured calm. “This is an affront to me. I was fighting with Darrow when
you were still cowering in your floating castle pretending it’s a.d. 1200.”
      “Time does not prove one’s loyalty.” Lorn scoffs and touches his scars.
“Scars do.”
      “You took those fighting for the Sovereign. You were her sword. How
much blood did you draw for her? How many men did you watch burn at
the side of the Ash Lord?”
      “Do not speak of Rhea to me, girl.”
      Victra’s teeth glimmer in a cruel smile. “So there is a Rage Knight
beneath the wrinkles and moth-bitten rags.”
      Lorn surveys her, seeing the wrathfulness of youth in her, and he looks
to me, as if to wonder just what sort of man brings Golds like Tactus and
Victra to his side. Does he even know me? his eyes ask. No, he’s realizing.
Of course not.
      “Honor in the first. Honor in the last. Those are my family words.
Whereas you … young lady, well, the name Julii does not exactly lift one to
nobler purpose, does it? You’re just traders.”
      “My name has nothing to do with who I am.”
      “Snakes beget snakes,” Lorn replies, not even looking at her now.
“You mother was a snake. She begat you. Ergo, you are a snake. And what
do snakes do, my dear? They slither. They wait, coldblooded, cruel in the
grass, and then they bite.”
      “We could ransom her,” Sevro says. “Threaten to kill her unless
Agrippina joins us or at least stops pissing all over our plans.”
      “You’re a sinister little shit, aren’t you?” Victra asks.
      “I’m Gold, bitch. What’d you expect? Warm milk and cookies just
because I’m pocketsized?”
      Roque clears his throat, drawing eyes.
      “It seems we are being unfair, hypocritical even,” he observes. “All
here know my family is full of politicians. Some of you might even think I
come from noble blood and noble seed. But we Fabii are a dishonest breed.
Mother’s a Senator who lines her pockets with agricultural funds and
lowColor medical subsidies so that she can live in more homes than her
mother did. My paternal grandfather poisoned his own nephew over a
Violet starlet a quarter his age, who ended up stabbing him and blinding
herself when she discovered he killed the nephew, her lover. But that’s
nothing next to my great-great-uncle, who fed servants to lampreys because
he read Emperor Tiberius pioneered the strange passion. Yet here I am,
spawn of all that sin, and I wager no one here questions my loyalty.
      “Why then do we doubt Victra’s? She has remained steadfast to
Darrow since the Academy. None of you were there. None of you know
anything about it, so I insist you shut your mouths. Even when her mother
demanded she abandon Darrow and Augustus, she stayed. Even when the
Praetorians came to kill us on Luna, she stayed. Now she is here, when we
are little more than a ragtag coalition of bandits, and you question her. You
disgust me. It makes me sad to be amongst you bickerers. So if another man
or woman questions her loyalty, I will lose faith in this fellowship. And I
will leave.”
      Victra’s smile for him is like a sunrise, creeping, slow, then blindingly
bright. It disappears slower than I thought it might have. The warmth in her
surprises Roque as well, and his fair cheeks are quick to flush.
      “I am not my mother,” Victra announces. “Or my sister. My ships are
mine. My men are mine.” Her wide-set eyes are cool, almost sleepy, but
they flash as she leans forward now. “Trust me, and you will find reward.
But all that matters is what Darrow thinks.”
      All eyes turn to me and my silence. In truth, I was not thinking about
Victra, but about Tactus and wondering how easily he could tell that I kept
him at arm’s length. When I showed him love at first and he rejected the
violin, I grew embarrassed and hurt. So I pulled back. Better if I had been
true to how I felt and stayed the course. His walls would have broken. He
never would have left. He could still be here. I’ll not make the same
mistake again, least of all to Victra. I reached out to her in the hall, and I
will do so in this company.
      “Chance made us Golds,” I say. “We could have been born any other
Color. Chance put us in our families. But we choose our friends. Victra
chose me. I chose her, like I chose all of you. And if we cannot trust our
friends …” I look to Roque plaintively, seeking absolution in his eyes, “…
then what’s the point in breathing?”
      I look back to Victra. Her eyes say a thousand things, and the Jackal’s
words come back to me as he lay burned on his bed from the bomb. Victra
loves me. Could it really be so simple? She does all these things not for the
Julii way of gain and profit, but for that simple human emotion. I wonder,
could I ever love her? No. No, in another world, Mustang would never be a
warrior, would never be cruel. In any world, Victra would always be this.
Always a warrior, like Eo really. Always too wild and full of fire to find
peace in anything else.
      Mustang notices something pass between Victra and me.
      “Then it’s settled,” Mustang says. “Back to the matter at hand. Pliny
waits now with the main fleet. There, he has brought all of my father’s
bannermen to compose a document of formal surrender to the Sovereign
and a restructuring of Mars. The deal, as far as I understand it, will make
him the head of his own house. He, along with the Julii and the Bellona,
will be the powers on Mars. Once the peace is agreed upon, it will be sealed
with the execution of my father in the courtyard of our Citadel in Agea.”
Mustang looks around the table, letting gravity build behind her words. “If
we do not rescue my father, this war is done. The Moon Lords will not
come to our aid. In fact, they will send ships against us. Vespasian’s forces
from Neptune will turn around. We will be alone against the entire Society.
And we will die.”
     “Good. That makes things simple,” I say. “We take back our fleet, then
we take back Mars. Any ideas?”
33
A Dance

      I sleep with a dream of the past. My hand curled in the tendrils of her
hair. About us the vale lay quiet in slumber. Even the children did not yet
stir. The birds rested on knotted limbs in the pinewood nearby, and I heard
nothing but her breath and the crackling of the old fire. The bed smelled of
her. No scent of flowers or perfume. Just the earthy musk of her skin, of the
oils in the hair around my hands, of her hot breath as it warmed my cheek.
Her hair was of our planet. It was wild like mine, dirty like mine, red like
mine. A bird outside croons loudly. Incessantly. Louder. Louder.
      And I wake hearing someone at my door.
      Kicking aside sweaty sheets, I sit up on the edge of the mattress.
“Visual.” A holo appears of Mustang in the hall. I rise instinctively to let
her in, but when I reach the door, I pause. We have our plan. There’s
nothing left to discuss at this hour. Nothing from which any good could
come.
      I watch her on the holo. Shifting foot to foot, something in her hands.
If I let her in … it’ll just cost us both in the end. I’ve already hurt Roque.
Already killed Quinn and Tactus and Pax. Bringing her close now would be
selfish. At the very best, she survives this war and she learns the truth about
me. I back away from the door.
      “Darrow, stop being an ass and let me in.”
      My hand choses for me.
      Her hair is wet and loose, her uniform replaced by a black kimono.
How fragile she seems next to Ragnar, who lurks in the hall.
      “Told you,” she says to Ragnar. To me she says, “Knew you’d be
awake. Ragnar here was being stubborn. Said you needed to sleep. And he
wouldn’t take the food I brought him.”
      “Do you need something?” I ask more coldly than I intended.
      Her feet make a show of shuffling nervously. “I’m … afraid of the
dark.” She pushes past me. Ragnar watches this, eyes giving nothing away.
      “I told you to go to bed, Ragnar.”
      He does not move.
      “Ragnar, if I’m not safe here, I’m not safe anywhere. Go to bed.”
      “I sleep with my eyes open, dominus.”
      “Really?”
      “Yes.”
      “Well, do it in your bunk, Stained. That’s an order,” I say, hating the
master’s words as soon as they come from my mouth.
      Reluctantly, he nods his head and slips silently down the hall. I watch
him go as the door hisses closed. I turn to find Mustang inspecting my suite.
It’s more wood and stone than metal, the walls carved and worked with
woodland scenes. Strange the efforts these people go to in order to make
themselves feel part of history and not a piece of the future.
      “Sevro must pissed he’s not the only one lurking behind you
anymore.”
      “Sevro’s grown up a bit since you last saw him. He even sleeps in
beds.”
      She laughs at that. “Well Ragnar was so adamant I go away that I
thought you might have company.”
      “You know I don’t use Pinks.”
      “It’s big,” she says of the suite. “Six rooms for little old you. Aren’t
you going to offer me something to drink?”
      “Would you—”
      “No, thank you.” She tells the room’s controls to play music. Mozart.
“But you don’t really like music, do you?”
      “Not this sort. It’s … stuffy.”
      “Stuffy? Mozart was a rebel, a brigand of monolithic genius! A
breaker of all that was stuffy.”
      I shrug. “Maybe. But then the stuffy people got ahold of him.”
      “You’re such a roughneck sometimes. I thought that Pink of yours—
Theodora? Thought she would have managed to feed you some culture. So
what do you like, then?” She runs her hands along a carving of a wolf
leading its pack. “Not that electronic madness the Howlers thump their
heads to, I hope. Makes sense that the Greens came up with that … it’s like
listening to a robot having a seizure.”
      “Have much experience with robots?” I ask as she moves around the
Victory Armor in a room off to the side of the entry hall. The Sovereign
gave it to the Ash Lord when he burned Rhea. Mustang’s fingers play over
the frost-hued metal.
      “Father’s Oranges and Greens had a few robots in their engineering
labs. Ancient, rusted things that Father had refurbished and put in the
museums.” She laughs to herself. “He used to take me there back when I
wore dresses and my mother was still alive. Absolutely detested the things.
I remember Mother laughing about his paranoia, especially when Adrius
tried restarting one of the combat models from Eurasia. Father was
convinced that robots would have overthrown man and now rule the Solar
System if Earth’s empires had never been destroyed.”
      I snort out a laugh.
      “What?” she asks.
      “I’m just …” I catch my breath. “I’m trying to imagine the great
ArchGovernor Augustus having nightmares of robots.” Another bout of
laughter seizes me. “Does he suppose they’d want more oil? More vacation
time?”
      Mustang watches me, amused. “Are you all right?”
      “I’m fine.” My laughter gradually subsides. I hold my stomach. “I’m
fine.” I can’t stop grinning. “Is he afraid of aliens too?”
      “I never asked him.” She taps the armor. “But they’re out there, you
know.”
      I stare at her. “That’s not in the archives.”
      “Oh, no no. I mean we’ve never found any. But the Drake-
Roddenberry equation suggests the mathematic probability is N = R* x fp x
ne x fl x fi x fc x L. Where R* is the average rate of star formation in our
galaxy, where fp is the fraction of those stars that have planets … You’re
not even listening anymore.”
      “What do you suppose they would think of us?” I ask. “Of man?”
      “I suppose they would think we’re beautiful, strange, and inexplicably
horrible to one another.” She points down a hall. “Is that the training
room?” She flips off her slippers and walks away down a marble hall,
casting a look back at me over her shoulder. I follow. Lights come mutedly
to life as we pass. She slips ahead faster than I care to follow. I find her
moments later in the center of the circular training room. The white mat is
soft under my feet. Carvings line the wooden walls. “The House of
Grimmus is an old one,” she says, pointing to a frieze of a man in armor.
“You can see the Ash Lord’s first ancestor there. Aucus au Grimmus, the
first Gold to touch land in the Iron Rain that took the American eastern
seaboard after one of Cassius’s ancestors, forget his name, broke through
the Atlantic Fleet. Then there is Vitalia au Grimmus, the Great Witch, right
there.” She turns to me. “Do you even know the history of the things you
try to break?”
      “It was Scipio au Bellona who defeated the Atlantic Fleet.”
      “Was it?” she asks.
      “I’ve studied the history,” I say. “Just as well as you.
      “But you stand apart from it, don’t you?” She paces around me. “You
always have. Like you’re an outsider looking in. It was growing up away
from all this on your parents asteroid mine that did the trick, wasn’t it?
That’s why you can ask a question like ‘What would aliens think of us?’”
      “You’re just as much an outsider as I am. I’ve read your dissertations.”
      “You have?” She’s surprised.
      “Believe it or not, I can read too.” I shake my head. “It’s like everyone
forgets I only missed one question on the Institute’s slangsmarts test.”
      “Ew. You missed a question?” She wrinkles her nose as she picks a
practice razor from a bench. “I suppose that’s why you weren’t in Minerva.”
      “How did Pax manage to get picked by House Minerva, by the way?
I’ve always wondered … he wasn’t exactly a scholar.”
      “How did Roque end up in Mars?” she replies with a shrug. “Each of
us have hidden depths. Now, Pax wasn’t as bright as Daxo is, but wisdom is
found in the heart not the head. Pax taught me that.” She smiles distantly.
“The one grace my father gave me after my mother died was letting me
visit the Telemanus estate. He kept Adrius and me apart to make
assassination of his heirs more difficult. I was lucky to be near them.
Though if I hadn’t been, maybe Pax wouldn’t have been quite so loyal.
Maybe he wouldn’t have asked to be in Minerva. Maybe he’d be alive.
Sorry …” Shaking away the sadness, she looks back to me with a tight
smile. “What did you think of my dissertations?”
      “Which one?”
      “Surprise me.”
      “‘The Insects of Specialization.’” Snap. A practice razor slaps into my
arm, stinging the flesh. I yelp in surprise. “What the hell?”
      Mustang stands there looking innocent, swishing the practice blade
back and forth. “I was making sure you were paying attention.”
      “Paying attention? I was answering your question!”
      She shrugs. “All right. Perhaps I just wanted to hit you.” She lashes at
me again.
      I dodge. “Why?”
      “No reason in particular.” She swings. I dodge. “But they say even a
fool learns something once it hits him.”
      “Don’t quote …” She slashes, I twist aside. “… Homer … to me.”
      “Why is that dissertation your favorite?” she asks coolly, swinging at
me again. The practice razor has no edge, but it is as hard as a wooden cane.
I leave my feet, twisting sideways out of the way like a Lykos tumbler.
      “Because …” I dodge another.
      “When you’re on your heels, you’re a liar. On your toes, you spit
truth.” She swings again. “Now spit.” She hits my kneecap. I roll away,
trying to reach the other practice razors, but she keeps me from them with a
flurry of swings. “Spit!”
      “I liked it …” I jump backward. “… because you said ‘Specialization
makes us limited, simple insects; a fact … from … which Gold is not
immune.’”
      She stops attacking and stares accusatorially, and I realize I’ve fallen
into a trap.
      “If you agree with that, then why do you insist on making yourself
only a warrior?”
      “It’s what I am.”
      “It’s what you are?” she laughs. “You who trust Victra. A Julii. You
who trusted Tactus. You who let an Orange give strategic recommendations.
You who gives command of your ship to a Docker and keeps an entourage
of bronzies?” She wags a finger at me. “Don’t be a hypocrite now, Darrow
au Andromedus. If you’re going to tell everyone else they can choose their
destiny, then you damn well better do the same.”
      She’s too smart to lie to. That’s why I’m so ill at ease around her when
she asks me questions, when she probes things I can’t explain. There’s no
explainable motivation to so many of my actions if I am really an
Andromedus who grew up in my Gold parents asteroid mining colony. My
history is hollow to her. My drive confusing … if I was born a Gold. This
must all look like ambition, like bloodlust. And without Eo, it would be.
      “That look,” Mustang says, taking a step back from me. “Where do
you go when you look at me like that?” The color slips from her face,
retreating into her as her smile slackens. “Is it Victra?”
      “Victra?” I almost laugh. “No.”
      “Then her. The girl you lost.”
       I say nothing.
       She’s never pried. She’s never asked about Eo, not when we shared
time together after the Institute when I was a rising lancer. Not when we
rode horses at her family’s estate or walked through the gardens or dove in
the coral reefs. I thought she must have forgotten I whispered the name of
another girl as I lay with her in the Institute’s snows. How stupid of me.
How could she forget? How could it not linger there inside her, forcing her
to wonder, as she lay with her head on my chest listening to my heart beat,
if it didn’t belong to another girl, a dead girl.
       “Silence isn’t the right answer right now, Darrow.” After a moment,
she leaves me alone in the room. Sounds from her feet fade. The Mozart
disappears.
       I chase after her, reaching her before she finds the door to the hall. I
grab her wrist. She flings me off.
       “Stop it!”
       I reel back, startled.
       “Why do you do this?” she asks. “Why do you pull me back if you’re
just going to push me away?” Her fists ball like she wants to strike me. “It’s
not fair. Do you understand that? I’m not like you … I can’t just … I can’t
just shut off like you do.”
       “I don’t shut off.”
       “You shut me off. After that speech about Victra … about the
importance of friends …” She snaps her fingers in front of my face. “You
can still cut me away like that. You care and then you don’t. Maybe that’s
why he likes you so much.”
       “He?”
       “My father.”
       “He doesn’t like me.”
       “How could he not? You are him.”
       I back away from her and find rest on the edge of the bed. “I’m not
like your father.”
       “I know,” she says, releasing some of her anger. “That’s not fair to
you. But you will become him if you follow this path alone.” She puts her
hand on the door controls. “So ask me to stay.”
       How can I let her? If she gives me her heart, I’ll break it. My lie is too
great to build a love upon. When she discovers what I am, she will reject
me. Even if she could survive that, I would not. I look at my hands as if the
answer is there.
    “Darrow. Ask me to stay.”
    When I look up, she is gone.
34
Blood Brothers

      Lorn’s scouts capture the camel vessel as it brings foodstuffs to Pliny’s
fleet gathered around Hildas Station, a star-shaped hub of trade and
communications on the fringes of the asteroid belt between the orbits of
Mars and Jupiter. For fifteen hours, I hide with Roque, Victra, Sevro, the
Howlers, the Telemanuses, Lorn, Mustang, and Ragnar amongst boxes and
crates of vacuum-sealed protofiber meals. Ragnar crushed the first box he
sat on, sending meals scattering everywhere, before he left the humid cargo
bay for the subzero freezer unit.
      Sevro cuts open a half dozen of the meals and nibbles throughout the
journey, sharing with the Telemanuses and his Howlers while Roque sits
speaking with Victra in the corner. Mustang leans against Daxo, sharing
stories with Kavax about Pax. She avoids my gaze.
      I tried apologizing before we boarded the ship, but she cut me off
fastlike. “Nothing to apologize about. We’re adults. Let’s not sulk and
bicker like children. There’s things to be done.”
      The words grow colder as I roll them over and over again through my
mind.
      Lorn nudges me with his boot. “Try to be less obvious, boy. You’re
staring.”
      “It’s complicated.”
      “Love and war. Same coin. Different sides. I’m too wrinkled for
either.”
      “Maybe war will breathe some life into your old bones.”
      “Well, I tried love last month.” He leans close. “Didn’t work like it
used to.”
      “Too honest, Lorn.” I can’t help but laugh.
      He grunts and adjusts himself on the boxes, groaning audibly as
something pops in his back. “So that’s the reason for all this. Helping poor
old man Lorn get his fix of war.” His anger has not yet dissipated, nor do I
expect it to. “Let me return the favor to you. The key today will be tact. The
Praetors, Legates, and bannermen you attempt to woo are not fools. And
they do not suffer fools. Pliny has given them valid argument. He’s aligned
their interests with his. You must counter with the same.”
      “Pliny is a leech,” I say. “A liar as much as you’re an honest man.”
      “And that makes him dangerous. Liars make the best promises.” Lorn
plays with his griffin ring, no doubt thinking of the beast and of the
grandchildren on his ships in the fleet. He brought his whole household off
of Europa, three million men and women of all Colors. “I could not leave
them,” he told me when I noted the size of his fleet as we left that water
moon. “Octavia would come and burn the home while we’re away.” So they
left their floating cities and set to the stars. The civilians will separate from
my fleet soon, hiding in the infinite black space between the planets. His
three surviving daughters-in-law will guide them.
      “And Pliny has the power of the Sovereign behind him,” Lorn
continues. “It will be difficult to dissuade them. Speaking of the Sovereign
… I noticed that you have something of hers.”
      “The Pax?”
      “No. Smaller. Though not much smaller. The Stained that was here.”
      “Ragnar?”
      “If that’s its name,” Lorn says.
      “His name,” I say. “He was meant to be a gift to the Julii for betraying
Augustus.”
      “Saw it in the Citadel’s arena once—scary as some of the things that
hide in Europa’s seas.”
      “He might be an Obsidian, but he’s still a man.”
      “Biologically, maybe. But he’s bred for one thing. Don’t forget that.”
      “You treat your own servants kindly. I expect you to treat mine the
same.”
      “I treat people kindly. Pinks, Browns, Reds are people. Your Ragnar is
a weapon.”
      “He chose me. Tools don’t choose.”
      “Have it your way, but know the consequences.” Lorn shrugs and
mutters something further under his breath.
      “Say what you want to say.”
      “You’re going to fall into trouble because you believe that exceptions
to the rule make new rules. That a bad man can be good simply because he
says he can or simply because he does so once when you are watching. Men
do not change. That is why I killed the Rath boy. Learn the lesson now, so
you don’t have to learn it with a knife in your back later. The Colors exist
for a reason. Reputations exist for a reason.”
      For the first time, he seems small and old to me. It’s not his wrinkles.
It’s what he says. He is a relic. Thoughts like his belong to the age I am
trying to destroy. He can’t help what he believes. He’s not seen what I’ve
seen. He’s not come from where I’ve been. He had no Eo to push him, no
Dancer to guide him, no Mustang to give him hope. He grew up in a
Society where love and trust are as scarce as grass in the desert. But he’s
always wanted both. He’s like a man planting seeds, watching them grow
into trees, only for his neighbors to cut them down. It will be different this
time. And if all goes well, I will give him back a grandson.
      “You taught me once, Lorn. I’m a better man for it. But now it’s my
turn to teach you. Men can change. Sometimes they have to fall. Sometimes
they have to leap.” I pat his knee and gain my feet. “Before you die, you’ll
realize it was a mistake to kill Tactus, because you never gave him the
chance to believe he was a good man.”
      I find Ragnar lying on the ground in the freezer unit, at home in the
bitter chill. His shirt is off, so I see the frightening angles of his tattooed
body. Runes everywhere. Protection over his back. Malice over hands.
Mother over his throat. Father over his feet. Sister behind his ears. The
mysterious skull marks of Stained upon his face.
      “Ragnar,” I say, sitting. “Not much for company, are you?”
      He shakes his head, the white ponytail curls on the floor. Eyes like
stains of pitch stare at me, measuring. Second eyes, tattoos on the backs of
his eyelids, are strange, pupils like those of a dragon or a snake, so that
when he blinks, his animal soul sees into the world around.
      I sit watching him, wondering how to say what I want to say.
Obsidians are the most alien of the Colors.
      “By offering me stains, you are bound to me. What does that mean to
you?”
      “It means I obey.”
      “Unconditionally?” He does not answer. “If I asked you to kill your
sister or your brother?”
      “Are you asking me this?”
      “It is a hypothetical.” He does not understand the notion when I
explain it.
     “Why plan?” he asks. “You plan. You decide. I do or I do not, there is
no plan.” He considers his next words carefully. “Mortals who plan die a
thousand times. We who obey die but once.”
     “What is it that you want?” I ask. He doesn’t stir. “I’m speaking to
you, Stained.”
     “Want.” He chuckles. “What is want?” The derision in his voice comes
from a deeper place than our godless realm. He’s alien here, because we
grow his kind in worlds of ice and monsters and ancient gods. We get what
we pay for. “You name it, so you think I know it. Want.”
     “Don’t play games with me and I won’t play them with you, Ragnar.” I
wait a long moment. “Must I repeat myself?”
     “Gold plans. Gold wants,” he rumbles slowly. Time between each
sentence. “Wanting is your heartbeat. We of the Allmother do not want. We
obey.”
     “On your knees?” He says nothing in reply, so I continue. “You once
wore shackles, Ragnar. Now the shackles don’t weigh you down. So …
what do you want?” He doesn’t respond. Is it petulance? “Surely you want
something.”
     “You struck off the shackles of others and seek to bind me with the
shackles like your own. Your wants. Your dreams. I do not want.” He says
it again. “I do not dream. I am Stained. Destined by Allmother Death to
deliver her promise.” His face shows me nothing, but I feel petulance in the
man. “Did you not know?”
     I examine him warily. “You make yourself look dumber than you
really are.”
     “Good.” He sits up swiftly, before I even have time to move back.
Bloodydamn, he’s fast. He takes out a knife and very quickly cuts his palm.
“When I offered stains, I bound myself to you. Forever. Till nothing.”
     I know this is their way. And I know what horrors he went through to
gain the title of Stained. He is not a man of half oaths or half measures. To
be an Obsidian is to know misery. To be a Stained is to be misery. And it is
to angle themselves one way in life—to serve their Golden gods, like
myself, if they are so lucky. We take their strong. We leave their weak. We
send Violets with tech to make lightning shows on hillsides. We sow
famine, then descend with food. We send plagues, then bless them with
Yellows to heal their sick and cure their blind. We have Carvers seed
monsters in their oceans and griffins and dragons in their mountains. And
when we are displeased, we destroy their cities with bombardments from
orbit. We make ourselves their gods. And then we bring them into our
world to serve our greedy aims. We want. They obey. How could Ragnar
ever be what I need him to be?
      “What if I wanted to you be free?”
      He flinches back. Eyes expressing a deep fear. “Freedom drowns.”
      “Then learn to swim.” I set a hand on his massive shoulder. Muscles
like rocks beneath the skin. “One brother to the other.”
      “We are not brothers, Sunborn,” he says, his voice wavering. “You are
master. Do you not understand? I obey. You command.”
      I tell him he chose me for his master. I did not take him, as he thinks.
And it was he, not I, who commanded the assault team that took Kellan au
Bellona’s ship. He did that. There was no Gold to guide him. No Gold to
make him a leader. But that alone is not enough. What would Eo say to
him? What would Dancer say?
      “Our Color is the same,” I tell him. He doesn’t understand, so I cut my
finger. Red blood comes out and I smear this on the black Sigils that mark
his Color on his hands. Then I take his blood and smear it over the gold on
the back of my hands.
      “Brothers. All water. All flesh. All made from and bound for the dirt.”
      “I do not understand,” he says fearfully, actually scooting back and
away from me till I have him cornered like a little child. “We are not the
same. You are from the sun.”
      “I am not. I was born six inches from the dirt. Ragnar Volarus, I
release you from my service, whether your like it or not. I will not let you
be bound. I will not let you be led. You stay in this icebox till you are man
enough to decide what you want. You shoot yourself in the head. You freeze
yourself to death. Go ahead. But whatever you do, it will be because you
chose to do it. Perhaps you’ll choose to follow me. Perhaps you’ll choose to
kill me. Whatever it is you decide, you must decide for yourself.”
      He stares at me, eyes wide with terror.
      “Why?” he rumbles. “Why do you shame me? In all the worlds, no
man would reject a Stained. I choose to offer myself and you spit on me.
What have I done?”
      “When you offer yourself, you offer your brothers and sisters and
people into slavery as well.”
      “You do not know.” Ragnar seethes. “We live to serve. If we do not,
Gold will end us. We will be no more. I have seen fire rain from the sky.”
      Centuries ago, in the Dark Revolt, the Golds killed more than nine-
tenths of his Color. Exterminated them like culling a population of
predators. That is the only history they know. The one we give them. Fear.
      “The history of men is kept from you, Ragnar. The Golds teach you
that you have always been slaves. That Obsidians exist to serve, to kill. But
there was a time before Gold where man was free.”
      “Every man?” he asks.
      “Every man. Every woman. You were not born to serve Gold.”
      “No,” he rumbles. “You tempt me. You bait me. I have seen this
before. I have seen false words meant to trick. The true words are known to
me, to us. Our mothers teach them. ‘Fear and serve the men of Gold. Or
they will come with iron from the sky. Gold will treat you with fire of the
Sunborn. For they are not bound by love. Not bound by fear. Not bound to
earth, but to sky and sun. Fear and serve the men of Gold.’”
      “I do not serve them.”
      “Because you are one of them.”
      “What if I told you I was not?”
      He stares at me. No answer. No movement. Nothing. Just confusion.
And so I tell him. I tell him in that freezer what Dancer told me in the
penthouse. We have been deceived. “I had a wife,” I tell him. “They took
her from me. They hanged her. They made me pull her feet so that her neck
would break and she would not suffer. I killed myself after that, burying
her, letting them win. Letting them hang me. I drowned in grief.” I tell him
how the Sons came for me. “And Ares gave me a second chance, the same
chance you now have to do something.
      “For seven hundred years we have been enslaved, Ragnar. Your
people. My people. We have been kept in darkness. But there will come a
day when we walk in the light. It will not come from their mercy. It will not
come by fate. It will come when good men and good women rise up and
choose to break the chains and live for more. You must choose for yourself.
Will you choose the hard path? Will you choose to be my friend? Will you
rise with me? Or will you choose the trodden path and let your mother, your
father, your sisters and brothers die never knowing there was a chance for
something else?”
      I leave after that. I do not swear him to silence. I do not demand an
answer. Dancer demanded none from me. I had to make the choice. If I had
not, if I had been forced into service, then I would have given up a thousand
times. Slaves do not have the bravery of free men. That is why Golds lie to
lowReds and make them think they are brave. That is why they lie to
Obsidians and make them think it is an honor to serve gods. Easier than the
truth. Yet it takes only one truth to bring a kingdom of lies crashing down.
      Ragnar must join me, because Red alone will not be enough.
35
Teatime

      Our disguise in the camel ship holds as we approach the fleet around
Hildas Station, aiming for what was once Augustus’s flagship, now Pliny’s.
Invictus. RipWings fly silently past us, requesting clearance codes. Our
pilot sends the codes and we are escorted to join a procession of supply
ships that funnel into the Invictus’s hangar, like caravan traders lining up
outside the grand gates of some desert citadel. Guns track us as we taxi.
      We land with a thud. The pilot pops open the aft bay doors and me and
mine hop from the ship down to the hangar’s floor. Instead of greeting
Brown haulers like she might have expected, the Orange Docker looks up
from her datapad to see a war party in full armored panoply. Armed to the
teeth. Without hesitation, she sits down, wanting no part of this.
      Sevro laughs and pats her on the head. “Wiser than Gold.”
      A circus of ships fills the bay. Lights glow down from the high ceiling.
Oranges and Reds scuttle about. Welding torches sizzle against hulls. Men
and women shout at each other. My fellows follow me, walking through the
hangar toward the lifts where we can access the rest of the ship.
      And as we walk, silence spreads like wildfire. Welding torches cease
to sizzle. Men no longer call out. Then simply stare. I stalk forward in the
front with Lorn. Mustang and Kavax au Telemanus flank us. Roque follows
with Sevro and Daxo. Victra comes next with the Howlers. And then behind
them all, like some sort of pale, giant shepherd, comes Ragnar.
      He chose to join us from the freezer. We exchange a look, and in one
nod, I know I have a new general for the rebellion. I swell with confidence.
      Not a soul protests our movement, though by our attire they know we
do not come for peaceful talks. My armor is black. Carved with roaring
lions. A thin pulseShield flickers over it. On my left arm, my aegis
activates, its opaque blue surface drinking in the light. My white razor
slithers on my arm. Our boots make the sound of hail on the metal decks. I
dispatch Pebble to have her Green squads crash the ship’s communications
system.
      A Copper sees us and makes a deal of playing with his datapad.
Ragnar slips up to him, touches his shoulder hard enough to push the man
to his knees. “No.”
      We enter the lift and the guts of the ship without a shot being fired. We
take the lift to the deck one above the command level. The lift doors open,
bringing us face-to-face with a squad of Gray marines.
      “Captain, you’re to accompany Virginia au Augustus to the
engineering bay,” I say to the Gray. His eyes appreciate the gravity of the
situation; after barely a hesitation, he salutes. His confused men fall in
behind Mustang and the Telemanuses as they head off at a trot.
      The ship alarm begins to wail.
      The Howlers go to the engines and life support systems as my own
force continues three decks up, heading not for the command deck, where
Pliny will be hosting his new allies, but for the brig. Roque, Victra, Lorn,
Sevro, and Ragnar slip in through the doors, subduing the guards before I
even enter.
      The prisoners, some forty Peerless Augustus Loyalists, are imprisoned
in small duroglass cells. Sevro walks past each, freeing the men and women
inside with a datakey as he goes.
      “Thank the Reaper,” he says to each, repeating it four times to a
towering old Peerless woman till she finally realizes she’s not getting out
till she plays his little game. They each roll their eyes and say thank you.
“What a good, abnormally tall and decrepit Peerless you are. Excellent,”
Sevro says, and lets the woman out. “Lorn! I found a possible bedmate.” He
pauses as he comes before the Jackal’s glass cage.
      “What do I spy with my little eye?” Sevro says happily. “Wait! I have
two again!”
      “Let me out,” the Jackal replies flatly. “I’m not playing your game,
Goblin.”
      “Thank the Reaper. And the name’s Sevro. You know that.”
      The Jackal rolls his eyes. “Thank you, Reaper.”
      “Bow like a good servant.”
      “No.”
      “Just let him out,” Lorn grumbles.
      “He has to play my game!” Sevro says. “Shithead isn’t getting out till
he plays nice. I’ll give him a riddle instead. “What do I have in my pocket?”
      I grow tired of the game, so behind his back, I point to my eye.
      “An eyeball,” the Jackal says.
      “Gorydammit, who told him?”
      Roque takes the key from Sevro’s hand and scans it over the cell’s
console. The Jackal joins us. “Grow up, Sevro,” Roque mutters.
      “The hell is your problem?” Sevro asks. “We need to take our time
anyway. Can’t let me have a little bit of fun?”
      We take our time so Pliny can fear what we’re doing. He must suspect
the loyalty of most of the crew. But no doubt he has a contingent of bought-
and-paid-for soldiers on board. Mercenaries, most likely. He’ll hide behind
them like a shield.
      “Where’s your father?” I ask the Jackal.
      “I don’t know,” he says. “I don’t believe he’s on the ship. My sister
make it to you safely?”
      “She found us.”
      “Good,” he says, turning quickly to acknowledge Lorn. “A pleasure,
Arcos. My father forbade me from reading your exploits as a child. Still I
managed. Tales of Old Stoneside kept me up late into the night.”
      “As did your performance at the Institute,” Lorn replies with a small
smile for me. “I was afraid to close my eyes after seeing your campaign.”
      The Jackal chuckles. “Seems your mission was a success on Europa,
Darrow.”
      “They sprang the trap as we hoped. And Aja escaped.”
      “Then let’s go fix this problem and get on with our war.”
      Roque looks back and forth between us, perhaps noting the familiarity
with which we speak. Yet another thing I never told him. The gulf grows.
      We meet Mustang in the lowColor galley during lunch hours.
Hundreds of Orange deckhands and electricians mingle with the Red
factory workers and Brown janitors. The buzz of conversation and the
clatter of plastic trays on metal tables falters as soon as Ragnar enters the
galley. Dead silence except an overexcited Brown janitor who screams at
the top of his lungs. His comrades quickly cover his mouth.
      Ragnar walks to the center of the room and moves one of the tables
without waiting for the lowColors to get up. Pulling it free of its metal
bolts, he drags it screeching across the metal floor, lowColors still sitting on
the attached benches. They stay motionless, eyes huge and terrified and
utterly confused at the sight of my cadre of fifty Golds.
      The Telemanuses follow Ragnar, carrying between father and son a
circular metal device one meter thick, two meters in diameter—the purpose
of their trip to the engineering bay. Their arms are covered by armor, but the
veins of their necks bulge under its weight. Mustang guides them, looking
at her datapad. “Here,” she says. They drop it where she points. The Grays
follow, carrying a huge battery unit, which they set on top of a nearby table.
      “Howlers, make some noise,” I say into my com.
      “Pardon me. Excuse me. Sorry,” Pebble says, waving her pudgy little
hands. She takes a cable from the battery unit and attaches it to the disc.
      There’s a crackle as the ship’s speakers activate. “Pliny,” a voice calls
sweetly. I look around for Sevro and see him at a terminal with two of the
Greens.
      “Sevro!” Mustang and I snap.
      He holds up a finger for us to wait.
      “He’s on the com,” one of the Greens jabbers out sincerely. “Just a
sec.”
      “Dear Pliny,” Sevro sings over the com.
       If your heart beats like a drum,
       and your leg’s a little wet,
       it’s ’cause the Reaper’s come
       to collect a little debt.
     He sings this three times until Ragnar throws a table into the console.
Sparks shower out. Sevro looks up slowly at the table hanging over his
head. It missed by inches. He wheels around. “What the gorypissandshit is
your damage, you overreacting mountain troll!”
     “Rhyming … nnnngh.” Ragnar makes an uncomfortable groaning
sound.
     “You found him,” Mustang mutters as we share a look.
     “Which one?” I ask as Sevro curses the Stained out in every compound
manner he knows. Adding the crux for good measure.
     “You squawk like a … like a chicken,” Ragnar says in reply.
     “He can’t insult me,” Sevro says, aghast. He looks at me. “Control
him.”
     I wash my hands of it.
     “If I may suggest continuing,” Lorn says.
     “Right. Serious faces, everyone.” Helmets slide from armor to cover
our skulls. I see thermal readings, power levels in the digital display. “Prime
it,” I tell Mustang.
       She activates the leechCraft thermal drill. It’s meant to burrow through
the outer hull of a ship and create a breech large enough for a boarding
party to pour through. So carving through the floor of a ship is nothing. And
we’re only one deck above the command rooms. I jump atop the drill.
       Momentum is everything to a Helldiver, to military endeavors, to life.
Keep moving and dare someone to get in your path.
       “You know what I said earlier,” Lorn asks me.
       “About tact?” I ask.
       He grins evilly behind his beard. “Slag tact. Terrify them.”
       I look at Mustang. “Burn.”
       She presses a button. The drill glows red. Heat radiates up into me.
Spreads along the floor. LowColors flow away, abandoning their food,
fleeing the room as the floor sags and melts like sand pouring down an
hourglass. The drill falls through the dripping deck into the command room
with me riding on its back. A Helldiver again, if only for a moment.
       It slams into the middle of Augustus’s great wooden table, sheaving
through and impacting like a meteor into the marble floor, still melting. I
cut the power cable with my razor and rise amidst the smoke and steam and
leaping flames as the table catches fire.
       A hundred Golds of the Society stare up at me. Praetors, Legates,
Judiciars, and knights of powerful houses stand with their razors drawn. All
once loyal to Augustus. All now under Pliny’s thumb. Going with the wind,
as they say.
       And there he is, at the head of the long table, his face fast paling.
Beautiful, clever Pliny. One eye left, the other sporting a temporary bionic
replacement. At his right sits one of the Furies, the Politico, Moira.
Compared with Aja, she’s a puffy pastry of a woman. But her sweet smile is
half again as sinister as her sister’s razor. Beside her is an Olympic Knight,
the Storm Knight from the Japanese Isles of Earth.
       “My goodmen!” I bellow through the voice amplifier in my helmet. “I
have come for Pliny.” I jump down from the drill, helmet rippling back into
my armor so they can see my face. I walk toward him. My friends follow
through the hole. Arcos first. Then Mustang and Sevro.
       “You said he was dead!” someone to my left snarls, razor half-pulled.
       “Lorn au Arcos?” murmurs another. His name rips through the place as
Sevro and Roque secure the doors leading into the room.
      “And KAVAX AU TELEMANUS!” Kavax booms wildly as he lands.
Guess Pax had to learn it somewhere.
      “The Reaper is not dead,” Mustang says, hopping down from the drill.
“Nor am I. Nor is my brother. And we have come to reclaim what belongs
to our father.”
      These Peerless don’t know what to do.
      “Liars!” Pliny cries. “You betrayed the ArchGovernor. Seize the
traitors!”
      Lorn makes a simple proclamation. “If anyone comes within two
meters of Darrow, I kill everyone in this room.”
      They don’t seem eager to call his bluff. The men I walk between jump
backward. Lorn’s reputation carves a hole for me straight to Pliny. I don’t
break pace.
      “Pliny,” I say. “We must speak.”
      “Kill him!” Pliny screams. “Kill the Reaper.”
      A young man lurches forward and dies as his neighbor stabs him in the
back. The neighbor looks fearfully to Lorn.
      “Two point three meters,” Lorn says. “Close.”
      “Kill him!” Pliny shouts futilely. “He’s a just a boy!”
      I speak quietly, but all can hear.
      “Pliny au Velocitor, you are a traitor to ArchGovenor Nero au
Augustus. You have conspired to destroy his house, to forcibly marry his
daughter, to kill his son, and betray him to the Sovereign, who has set
herself against him. Your master raised you up, and you tried to tear him
down. You have betrayed his trust all for personal gain. Worst of all, you
have failed.”
      “Stop him!” Pliny screams now, wildly gesticulating at me. “Moira!”
      Moira whispers to the Storm Knight, and both step to the side.
      “You’re supposed to be dead,” Pliny mutters. “Aja said she would kill
you on Europa.”
      “And who do you know that can kill me?” I say, that ridiculous Gold
rage building in my voice so that it might impress all these hungry souls.
“The Jackal failed. Antonia au Severus-Julii failed. Proctors Apollo and
Jupiter failed. Cassius au Bellona failed. Karnus failed. Cagney failed. Aja
au Grimmus and her Praetorians failed.” The hangman failed. The mines
and pitvipers failed. “And now you fail.”
      That’s when I slip forward, faster than a striking pitViper and slap him
across the face. He pitches sideways out of his seat like a leaf battered by
the wind, careening into a Gold who stood to the side. She spits on him and
moves for me.
      “You are a worm who thought himself a serpent just because you
slither. But your power was not real, Pliny. It was all a dream. Time now to
wake.”
      Pliny scrambles to his feet, pushing himself away from me. His
carefully combed hair is a mess, and redness swells on his right cheek. I
spin him around and slap him again, harder. He’s startled. Doesn’t know
what to do. He was not taken from his bed during his first day at the
Institute and beaten by Obsidians. He did not ride upon the snow-crusted
beaches at the head of an armored column. He did not starve. So now all he
can do is scramble and cry.
      I seize him with my hands, raise him high into the air. But I hurt him
no more. I will not demean the moment with cruelty like Karnus or Titus
would. My condescension is my weapon. I set Pliny back in the
ArchGovernor’s chair. I buff his dragonfly pin. Straighten his hair like a
kindly mother. Pat him on his tear-stained cheek and extend my hand,
which bears my House Mars ring.
      He kisses it without me asking.
      “Goodbye, Pliny. I leave you to your friends.”
      I walk away, the eyes of all these Peerless following me, abandoning
Pliny. I hear a slurping sound and do not turn, because I know what razors
sound like when they kill. They didn’t even wait. Pliny is forgotten.
      These Peerless thump their chests in salute to me. The monsters. They
go with the wind, chasing power. But they don’t realize power doesn’t shift.
Power is resolute. It is the mountain, not the wind. To shift so easily is to
lose trust. And trust is what has kept me alive. Trust in my friends, and their
trust in me.
      The Sovereign knows this. It is why she keeps her Furies close. They
would die for her, as my friends would die for me. Because in the end, what
does all the power in all the worlds matter if your closest friends can betray
you? The Sovereign’s father learned that when his daughter took his head.
Pliny learned at the price of his life. I forgot it, distanced myself from my
friends, and nearly lost everything because of it when Tactus felt as
overshadowed and alienated with me as he did with his brothers. It is why I
started fresh with Victra, why I told Ragnar the truth, why I must make
amends with Lorn and Roque.
      Trust is why Red will have a chance. We are a people bound by song
and dance and families and kinship. These people are allies only because
they think they must be.
      I look at them now and I know they are so stern and so rigid that they
will break and shatter against each other, not because of me, but because of
what they are.
      I float on my gravBoots, pausing to say, “Tell all who will hear, the
Reaper sails to Mars. And he calls for an Iron Rain.”
36
Lord of War

      “Power is the crown that eats the head,” the Jackal said to me as we
planned the invasion. He spoke in reference to Octavia. But the truth
reaches further than that. These Golds have had power for so long. Look
how they act. Look what they want. They jump at the chance for war. They
come from near, from far, ships racing to join my armada as they learn that
I have called for an Iron Rain, the first in twenty years. I used the Jackal to
spread the news, along with footage of Pliny’s fall. Many of them are
second sons and daughters, who will not inherit their parents’ estates.
Warmongers, duelists, the glory-hungry. And each bring their attendants of
Grays and Obsidians. The worlds of the Society wait with bated breath to
see what happens today. If we lose, the Sovereign rules on. If we win—
complete civil war. No world can stand apart.
      Legions marshal within my ship as my armada gathers around the dock
moon of Phobos. I carry my razor curved as a slingBlade; crooked and
cruel, it is my scepter. My iron House Mars ring tightens as I flex my hand
and stare through the viewports. The pegasus bounces against my chest.
      I cannot see my enemy—Bellona and much of the Sovereign’s local
fleets—but they lie between me and my planet. The Sovereign’s ancient
Ash Lord comes fast from the Core to aid with his Scepter Armada, but he
is still a week away. He cannot help the Bellona today.
      My Blues watch me, and my generals—of Victra au Julii’s personal
fleet, who abandoned her mother’s forces, of House Arcos, of the House
Telemanus, and the bannermen of Augustus.
      Mars is green and blue and pocked with shielded cities. White caps
mark her poles. Blue oceans stretch along her equator. Fields of grass along
with thick forests coat her surface. Clouds swirl about her, a cotton shift to
hide her sparkling shielded cities. And there are guns. Great stations in the
deserts, around the cities, where shipkilling railguns point to the sky.
      My thoughts dip below the surface of the planet. I wonder what my
mother is doing now. Is she making breakfast? Do they know what comes?
Will they even feel it when we do?
      My fingers don’t tremble even on the brink of battle. My breath is
even. I was born to a family of Helldivers. I was born to bloodline of dust
and toil, born to serve the Golds. I was born to this velocity.
      Yet I am terrified. Mickey carved me to be a ‘god of war’. But why do
I feel like such a boy standing in silly armor? Why do I want to be five
years old again, before my father died, sharing the bed with Kieran,
listening to him talk in his sleep?
      I turn to the sea of Gold faces.
      This race—what a beautiful monster. They carry all of humanity’s
strengths, except one. Empathy. They can change. I know that. Perhaps not
now, perhaps not in four generations. But it begins today, the end of their
Golden Age. Shatter the Bellona, weaken Gold. Drive the civil war to Luna
itself and destroy the Sovereign. Then Ares will rise.
      I don’t want to be here. I want to be home, with her, with my child
who never was.
      But can’t be. I feel the tide inside me go out, baring old wounds. This
is for you, I tell her. For the world you should have lived in.
      And so I return my part, feeding these wolves.
      “In the fading days of autumn …” I say, voice loud and bold, “… the
Reds who mine the bedrock of Mars wear masks of happy ghouls to
celebrate the dead claimed by the red soil, to honor their memories and
subdue their spirits. We Aureate took those masks and made them our own.
We gave them the faces of legend and myth to remind ourselves that there is
no evil, no good. No gods. No demons. There is only man. There is only
this world. Death comes for us all. But how will we shout into the wind?
How will we be remembered?” I pull off one of my gloves and cut my palm
very shallowly. I clench my fist till the blood coats my skin, and then press
my hand to my face. “Make your blood proud long after death claims you.”
      There’s the stomp of feet. Just one.
      “Luna is the new Earth. It rules us and makes us bow and scrape. Our
sacrifice means its gain. Again, the weak hold back the strong. After today,
when we take the Thousand Cities of Mars, our ranks will swell. The
Galilean Lords will swear for us. The Governors of Saturn will bow to us.
Neptune will come with her ships and we will cut off the leech that is
Octavia au Lune.”
      And make a tyrant king. It makes so much sense to them. I don’t know
how. A tyrant for a tyrant. How do they find inspiration from this? Men
always have.
      Another stomp.
      “Every moment today will be captured by the holoCams we’ve given
you.” Like it was at the Institute and when I took the Pax. The Jackal’s idea.
“Each moment will be remembered. If you win glory, it will be spread
across the HCs of every world. If you shame yourself or your family, it will
not fade with your death.” I look to Ragnar, as though he were my
headsman. Lorn rolls his eyes at the dramatic flair. “We will remember.”
      Stomp.
      “The cities are to be taken. The Golds who will not bend, killed. The
lowColors protected. We will not collapse the mines. We will not rape her
cities and despoil her verdant grounds. We are to capture the bounty of
Mars. We do not want to take her corpse. She is home to many of you, so
harm only the pest that destroys her from within. And when the glory of the
day is over—when you wipe the blood from your sword and give the cloth
to your sons and daughters, so they will remember you were party to one of
the greatest battles since the Fall of Earth— remember, you have made your
own destiny. It was not given to you by the Sovereign. It was not given to
you by a governor. You took it like our ancestors took the worlds. We are
the Second Conquerors.”
      Now there’s the roar. I hate how my body shivers at the idea of glory.
There’s something deep in man that hungers for this. But I think it
weakness, not strength, to abandon decency for that strange darker spirit.
      I look at the Jackal to the side of the bridge. He has little importance
on this day. He has done his work bringing all these men and women here.
He has muddled communications and sowed false information, leading
much of the Sovereign’s aid to the Bellona scattered chasing false rumors of
elements of my fleet sneaking off to attack Luna. A ploy only. My forces
are all here.
      “Quite the puppet master you play,” the Jackal whispers to me as we
wait for the Whites to enter the bridge behind the waiting Golds. Sevro
scoots closer to me, as if to remind the Jackal his place.
      “You made most of the strings. I never thanked you,” I say quietly
back to him.
      His plain face wrinkles with distaste. “Must we become sentimental?”
      “You helped Mustang escape. That’s why Pliny caught you.” He never
mentioned it, never boasted or used it as leverage. It was the simple act of a
brother helping a sister. I shrug. “And you tried your damnedest to save
Quinn. Maybe you’re a better man than you know.”
      He laughs that barking laugh of his. “Doubtful. But tomorrow, a traitor
will be king, and a Empress shall be traitor, so maybe wicked men can be
virtuous.”
      I look out the viewport. “Are your satellites ready?”
      “For the virus?” He nods. “My Greens will shut down all
communications as soon as you give the word. For fifteen minutes, it will
be quiet as death, for everyone. Their global and regional defensive units
won’t have surveillance or sensors. Time enough to shatter most of the
static positions.” He looks at his feet, as though suddenly self-conscious.
“Save my father if you can.”
      Sevro shifts, annoyed at our whispering.
      “I will.”
      I’d rather Augustus rot forever in a hole in the ground. But I need him
once Mars is taken. Despite what I can do, I’m not a Governor or a king. I
need his legitimacy, as Theodora reminded me last night. Without it, I’m
just an arm with a razor.
      “And you’re sure about Agea?” he asks. “About the prize? Otherwise
it’s reckless.”
      “One hundred percent.”
      “Good. Good. Prime luck then.” He moves away.
      “Replacing me already?” Sevro snorts, watching him go.
      “He’s got one hand. You’ve got one eye. I have a type.”
      The ceremonies continue. Two hundred Golds bend their knees as the
Whites walk through their ranks. I try to think it a stupid, solemn thing, all
these men and women with their pompous silence and their attention to
tradition. But this is the history of mankind in the making. And there is a
nobility to the moment.
      Armor glints against the artificial light. Ethereal Whites wander
through the ranks, virgin maidens barefoot in snow-white cloaks, with
daggers of iron and laurels of gold. Child Whites carry the triangular golden
standards—a scepter, a sword, and a book crowned with a laurel. I feel
hands on my shoulders.
      I feel their weight.
      They say this is the way the Old Conquerors went to battle, with
virgins of White wounding them with iron. They touch our brows with the
laurel and cut our left palms with the iron as they whisper softly in our ears:
      “My son, my daughter, now that you bleed, you shall know no fear, no
defeat, only victory. Your cowardice seeps from you. Your rage burns bright.
Rise, warrior of Gold, and take with you your Color’s might.”
      Then each warrior smears the handprint of blood across his face and
across the top of his demonfaced helm. One by one we stand in silence.
Each Gold represents ten legions. This is the storm that will fall on Mars in
a torrent of metal. Ten million Golds, Grays, and Obsidians.
      “We do not fight a planet. We fight men and women. Cut off their
heads and see their armies crumble,” Lorn reminds us all.
      The assembly of warriors stands, faces now smeared with blood, and
together we recite the names of our chief enemies. “Karnus au Bellona, Aja
au Grimmus, Imperator Tiberius au Bellona, Scipia au Falthe, Octavia au
Lune, Agrippina au Julii, and Cassius au Bellona. These are wanted lives.”
      In the halls of my enemy, they will recite my name, and the names of
my friends. He who kills the Reaper will have bounty and renown.
Individual hunters and killgroups will scan our com signals, searching for
me. And in packs they will descend, some for single battle. Others for the
sly kill of a sniper’s bullet. Some will not even participate in the battle for
Mars. They are Gray mercenaries. Freed Obsidian bounty hunters. Knights
of Venus and Mercury here only for my head, using their family assets,
family soldiers, to help them privately stalk me and make their own glory.
The Jackal intercepted a communiqué that three of the Olympic Knights are
here. They all will have watched me, studied my recordings, my victories,
my defeats. And they will know my nature, the nature of my Howlers. But I
will not know them.
      Let them come make their introductions.
      I’m more interested in meeting Cassius. At least that’s what I told
Lorn. But he knows that’s not true. A deep shame burns in me for how I
yelled like a monster at his family. I beat him fairly, but I didn’t have to like
it as much as I did. Sometimes I wonder if he were raised a Red and I a
Gold if he wouldn’t have ended up a better man than I am now, and I a
worse man than he ever could be.
      For some reason I think I could have been capable of great evil. Maybe
that’s the guilt. Maybe that’s the fear of a life where I never knew Eo. I
don’t know. Or maybe it’s the fear of knowing how easily I fall to pride.
      My warriors disperse back to their own family vessels. I watch out the
viewport as half a hundred shuttles streak away to the great armada we’ve
assembled. Though they know we’re here now, our enemies did not expect
us to come to Mars so quickly.
      I turn my attention to my remaining commanders. Orion will lead the
Pax and Roque will lead the fleet in conjunction with Victra. I approve of
their plan. The rest of my inner circle lingers, except for Mustang, who goes
ahead to the hangars.
      I reach up slightly to thump both of the Telemanuses on their
shoulders. “Pax would have looked brilliant this day.” Sophocles curls
around Kavax’s ankles.
      “My brother always looked brilliant,” Daxo says warmly. “Silly,
shouting, trying to be like Father. But brilliant nonetheless. We’ll kill
Tiberius au Bellona, don’t you worry.”
      “Do I look worried?”
      Both Titans nod their giant heads. Kavax has gone into his battle quiet.
He cannot speak except to mumble, so Daxo continues to speak for him.
“Take care of yourself, Reaper.” He spares a look back at the Jackal. “We
know it’s a marriage of necessity, but don’t trust him.”
      “You know I don’t.”
      “Do not trust him,” Daxo repeats.
      “I trust only friends.” We say our goodbyes.
      Orion’s brow is wrinkled in thought. I ask her if anything is the matter
as she leans over the scanner display. She’s assessing the enemy disposition
in the sync. “They noticed us come into orbit an hour ago. We were
vulnerable while filtering in, but they remained in defensive formation over
Agea.”
      “It is odd,” Roque agrees. “They cede much of the planet without a
flight. Perhaps it’d be better to orient your drop to the south …”
      “I want Agea,” I say coldly.
      “We’ll be shooting you into the thick, brother. The capital can wait.
Seize the other cities and we can take it without assault. Why such a wild
rush?”
      “If we take the capital, the other cities fall.”
      “And many men die.”
      “It is war, Roque. Trust me on this one.”
      “It’s your war.” Roque salutes. After catching a glare from Victra, he
extends a hand. “Fare thee well, Primus.” He kisses both my cheeks,
surprising me.
      “It’s been a long road,” I say carefully.
      “And we’ve miles to go before we sleep.”
      “My brother.” I clasp the back of his neck and bring his forehead to
mine. “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.” I shake my head. “For Quinn. For Lea. For
the gala. For a thousand slights I’ve laid upon you. You’ve been my dearest
friend.” Pulling back, I avoid his eyes. “I should have said it earlier. But I
was afraid.”
      “In what world should you be afraid of me?” he asks.
      I shake my head. “Forgive me, for everything.”
      “We’ll make amends later.” He claps my shoulder. “Prime luck.”
      I leave him. Lorn and I draw up just outside the bridge, where our
paths diverge into different halls. He’s shaved for war, and he wears his old
Rage Knight armor. He looks brilliant but smells terrible. These old knights
are like the Howlers. Superstitious and unwilling to wash their gear for fear
of washing away whatever luck kept them alive thus far.
      “I’ve received communiqués from many old friends,” Lorn says.
“They side with Bellona.”
      “All old men and women?”
      “The old have weathered many seasons of the young.” There’s a
twinkle in his eye. “But they ask me about you. They ask if the boy warlord
is really four meters tall. Is he really followed by a wolfpack? Is he a
worldbreaker?”
      “And what do you say?”
      “I said you are five meters tall, you’re followed by a midget and a
giant, and you eat glass with your eggs.” We share a laugh. “I don’t like that
you brought me here. I don’t believe you’re being the man you want to be.
If you survive this and I don’t, be better than the man who tricked his
friend.”
      A dull ache grows behind my eyes. It’s a plea he makes. Not for me to
feel guilty, but because he truly cares. I should be better. I want to be. I am
being better in the end. But with the means to reach that end … am I just
like all the other lost souls? Am I just another Harmony? Another Titus?
      “I promise,” I say, meaning it even as I intend to hurt him again and
again.
      “Good. Good.” He pops his leathery neck. “So after Agea, you take the
northern hemisphere. I’ll take the southern. And we meet back here for
whiskey. Deal, my goodman?”
      I nod, but still he does not separate.
      He stares at me for a moment and glances down, unable to meet my
gaze. Emotion thickens his voice. “Each time I returned to my wife, I told
her that her boys died well.” He fidgets with his ring. “There’s no such
thing.”
      “Achilles died well.”
      “No. Achilles let his pride and rage consume him, and in the end, an
arrow shot by a Pixie took him in the foot. There’s much to live for besides
this. Hopefully you’ll grow old enough to realize that Achilles was a
gorydamned fool. And we’re fools all the more for not realizing he wasn’t
Homer’s hero. He was his warning. I feel like men once knew that.” His
fingers tap his razor. “It’s a cycle. Death begets death begets death. It’s been
my life. I—I don’t think I should have killed the boy. Your friend.”
      “Why do you say that?”
      “Because I see the way the rest of them look at you. I think they’d do
anything for you because you believe in them.”
      I move suddenly, leaning down to kiss him on his weathered cheek the
way Reds kiss fathers and uncles. “Tactus wouldn’t have blamed you. And
neither do I. You’ve another grandson to raise. Maybe you can teach him
the peace you couldn’t teach me. So do us a favor, don’t die, old man.”
      “Ha,” the grizzled lord laughs, falsely at first. Then more forcefully as
he turns on a heel. “Ha! They’ve yet to make a man who can kill me!” His
old knights, craggy men and women, flank him, not one younger than
seventy, but I recognize all their faces from the histories of the Moon
Rebellion and other great battles. Their friends and former comrades wait
for us on Mars.
      I leave for the hangars, saying a quick farewell to Victra. She calls me
back. I feel Roque watching us. She looks about to say something. The red
sun of her black armor weeps blood. Black warpaint streaks diagonally
across her face. Eyes burning out of it, yet they are vulnerable, gentle as
they search mine for a reflection of what she feels.
      “After today, the name Julii will mean more than money,” I say. Her
plan will turn the tide of the space battle.
     “I don’t care about that.” Her fingers touch my breastplate and I see
her lips sliding sharply into that wicked smile of hers. “If you die, I want
your last thought to be how great a mistake it was to spend all those nights
alone in your stateroom at the Academy.” She flicks my armor, making a
pinging noise. “What a beautiful mess we could have made of each other.
     Theodora waits for me in the hall, giving me a look.
     “Oh, shut up.”
     “She would have eaten you up and spit you out, dominus.”
     “Why aren’t you in the staterooms where it’s safe?”
     “It’s not safe anywhere.” Theodora motions me to bend my head. She
puts a small red flower clip, the sort a young girl would wear, into my hair.
“All knights need their tokens,” she says, tearing up. “Don’t be too much a
hero. You’re too clever to die in a stupid battle.”
     She leaves, squeezing Ragnar’s forearm as she passes. I didn’t know
they were familiar. Ragnar follows along, hanging back like a hesitant
shadow as Sevro and I speak on the way to the hangars.
     “So it is done?” I ask Sevro.
     He shrugs. “I sent it.”
     “You spoke to him?”
     “A holoNet dropCache,” he says. “I send a message. They get it.
Hopefully.”
     “You mean you don’t know if they got it?”
     “How should I know? I said I sent it. Followed protocol.”
     I curse quietly. He whistles that damn tune he sang Pliny. I swat at
him. We turn a corner and pass six dozen Gray special ops troopers heading
for the tubes at a jog. Six Obsidians follow behind them, opening their
palms to Ragnar and me as signs of respect.
     “You see what they were wearing? SlingBlades on their armor.” Sevro
smirks over at me. “It spreads.”
     “Have you thought about what happens if your father is down there?” I
ask.
     “No,” he says, losing his smile. “No, I haven’t.”
37
War

      The forward hangar bay is massive. A giant cave in the belly of my
ship crawling with men and women of all Colors. Six hundred meters in
length. Along its left side are hundreds of spitTubes. Each row is accessed
by a network of giant causeways where men in starShells can walk.
Thousands stand ready to disperse, grouped according to legion.
      The alarm for battle stations warbles throughout the ship. Orion’s
voice rasps over the intercom. Beyond the hull, Roque, now the youngest
fleet commander in a hundred years, will be breaking our armada into fleets
to engage the Bellona over Mars. Squadrons of ripWings and wasps pour
forth. Blues flying to their deaths. Gold squad leaders in their midst. All to
carve a hole large enough for the leechCraft to swarm onto the enemy hulls.
Some Praetors hoard their soldiers to fight off enemy waves that make it
aboard their ships. Others launch full attacks. It’s a gamble either way.
Can’t think of it. Victra, Roque, and Orion have that responsibility. I have
my own.
      I pause, looking out at the hangar. “What if Ares isn’t real?” I ask
quietly.
      “What the hell you talking about?” Sevro asks.
      “What if it’s just a Gold trick? Someone pulling strings to make
Society go the way they need it to go. What if it’s all a lie?”
      Sevro looks at me for a long moment, then he hops up on a banister
and howls at the top of his lungs down at the hangar bay.
      The bay howls back.
      It comes from Grays. It comes from Obsidians. It comes from
Oranges. It comes from Reds working on tubes. And it comes from the
Golds who requested transfer to my ship.
      “That’s no lie.”
      And that’s when I see the standards of the legions fall, replaced with
something new. Gone are the pyramids of the society. Gone are the laurel
and the scepter and the sword and the book. Gone is Augustus’s lion.
Instead, the high golden standards that the legions carry to battle are peaked
with wolves and slingBlades.
     These legions are mine.
     I feel something buzzing in those around me. A sort of physical
fanaticism. It did not buzz in the Golds quite like this. The Golds love me
because of the victory and glory I bring. These other Colors love me for
something far different, something far more potent. Any other conquering
Gold would have vented the ship, but I did not because they chose me
instead of the Golds who once were their masters. I gave them that choice.
     Sevro grips my arm. “Do you understand that you must fight
differently today?”
     “I get it, Sevro.” I try to shake off his hand.
     “You don’t.” He pulls me to look at him and shoos Ragnar back.
“Every move you make today will be recorded and broadcast to every part
of the Solar System. This battle is to make the fleet yours.” His voice drops
to a harsh whisper. “The Sons will spread it. Jackal will spread it. House
Augustus will spread it. Act like a god, get followed like a god. Register?”
     “Win or lose, this is still Augustus’s fleet,” I say.
     “Not if he’s dead.”
     I assigned Sevro to infiltrate the Citadel in Agea where the
ArchGovernor is being held captive. But I did not tell him to kill Augustus.
     “You’re not going to kill him,” I say with authority. “I forbid it. It is
…”
     “Necessary. You don’t need his legitimacy. Haven’t you figured us out
yet? Here you get what you take, no matter the right of it.” He spits on the
ground. “You are twenty years old. If you win Mars, Darrow, you become a
living god. And so when you reveal what you really are … you transcend
Color. Do I register?”
     Sevro has grown wiser since we first met. No doubt about that. But I
fear he thinks too much of me. Apollo thought he was a god. Augustus
thinks he is. A god is not what I should be. A god is something to serve,
something to worship. I’ve never wanted that. Eo never wanted that. Sevro
will have to learn. This is about freedom. Yet it seems like everyone just
wants to follow.
     Mustang oversees the troop operations today. She floats through the air
with Milia, the horsefaced Gold we adopted at the Institute. Nearer me
saunters an ambling, pitiless Gold with a familiar face. I laugh and point
him out to Sevro, who curses poignantly.
     “Proctor Jupiter?” I call to the man. “Darling, could that really be
you?”
     “Who else would it be, you uppity brat?” Jupiter comes before me.
He’s tall. Careless in the eyes. Hair bound tight. Half a foot taller than me,
he’s a sinful, hedonistic beast of a man with an arrogant streak a kilometer
long, and it is clear that he and Ragnar are two misunderstandings away
from opening each other up. He eyes the razor wrapped around my forearm,
and I see his is worn in the same new fashion. “I heard you’re the one
responsible for the new style.” He holds up his arm. “I do approve. Bold as
a naked prick in an ant nest.”
     “Limping still?” Sevro asks.
     “Shut up, Goblin,” Jupiter sneers.
     “Daddy dearest had a little duel with Proctor Jupiter here to win the
Rage Knight post.” Sevro smiles. “Old man sliced him up the same place I
did. Right in the ass.”
     “That slippery slag Fitchner is … tricky.” Jupiter nods grudgingly.
“Very, very tricky. I have been helping the lady,” Jupiter rumbles on,
gesturing to Mustang.
     “How so?” I ask.
     “Most of the Augustus cities are on communication interdict. Can’t get
a word out or in. I’m the emissary to those still loyal. Sneak in. Sneak out.
Been doing it for weeks now and sending word to remote dropCaches and
the other loyal cities. A whole war’s been going on here with her agents and
her brother’s while you were out stitching together a fleet. It’s been nasty,
my goodman.”
     “So what can you tell me?” I ask.
     “Well, Daddy Bellona commands the house fleet against your friends.
Cassius and Karnus have been allocated to ground operations inside Agea. I
am going to help you find them and kill them.” Jupiter raises his large
eyebrows, as though telling us how tedious he finds the chore. “That is the
point—kill the Bellona family members and all their allies will suddenly
wonder why they’re fighting—isn’t it?” He winks at Sevro. “Next best
thing to pounding that Luneborn Sovereign’s head in.”
     “You sure all Bellona are in Agea?”
      Jupiter nods grudgingly. “Last we saw. That was a couple days ago,
though, after they brought Augustus down in chains.” He airily holds up a
finger. “And there was a peculiar series of heavy shuttles that landed last
night.”
      I wave a hand, ignoring mention of the shuttles. He squints at me, but I
tell him to shut up and get behind me as I meet Mustang and her entourage.
      “Everything is prepared,” she says. “We’re awaiting launch orders.”
She wrinkles her nose as if smelling something foul. “Sevro, do watch
Jupiter. He tends to shit where he eats.”
      Jupiter yawns. “Pleasure working with you too.”
      “Milia, lovely seeing you washed,” I say.
      “Reaper.” She nods and smiles, an ugly thing on her face. “Still
playing with scythes? Warms the heart.”
      “You’ve a heart?” Sevro chuckles.
      She examines his height. “A full-sized one.” She pauses. “I saw Pollux
just yesterday, on the other side, however. Been sneaking in and out with
Jupiter here. You’ve arranged us all a little reunion. I heard about Tactus.
He was a bastard.”
      True enough. I glance at my datapad. We’ll be at the launch
coordinates in five. My team disperses. Mustang lingers, face thoughtful.
      “What’s what?” I ask. “Worrying about me already?”
      “A little,” she confides, coming close enough for me to smell the scent
of her. “But it’s my father. What if they kill him before we even make
landfall?”
      “They won’t kill him. They’ll need him as a bargaining chip. Or if
they’ve lost, they’ll spare him and hope we do the same for all the Bellona
family members. You don’t kill men as important as him.”
      I reach for her hand to comfort her, but she pulls it away, turning from
me. “We have a planet to invade.”
      I watch her go, shouting orders to her men.
38
The Iron Rain

      All I see is metal. I’m one of a thousand in the honeycomb of
spitTubes. Beyond the metal tube, a battle rages. I feel nothing. Not the
shudder of the Pax. Not the missiles as they range through space to bring
silent death. Just the throbbing of my heart. Mickey told me it was the
strongest he’d seen in a Red, courtesy of the pitviper poison that traced my
veins when I was young. It makes my hands shake now as it gallops in my
chest. Fear rides in me. Fear of so many things. Fear of letting down my
friends, of losing my friends. Of telling my friends the truth about what I
am. Fear of being unequal to the task before me. Fear caused by doubt—in
myself, in my plans for the rebellion. Fear of death. Fear of being lost in the
darkness of space beyond the hull. Fear of failing Eo, my people, myself.
But chiefly, fear of hot metal.
      Chatter comes over the coms. Perfunctory. The plan is in motion, and
I’m nothing but a cog now. The battle is too large for me to take part in all
of it. I wanted to lead the Pax from her bridge so I could watch the enemy
ships fall to my fleet. But Orion and Roque are better than I am in space.
      I wanted to be in the leechCraft carrying the boarding parties through
the breech into enemy hulls; I wanted to storm bridges, repel invaders from
my own ship, bounce from destroyer to dreadnought, making them mine.
But I will not capture Imperator Bellona. The Titans will do that. In the end,
my enemies dictate where I go. I chase the grand prize.
      A prize that has been my target since after I left Luna.
      My true pegasus pendant is cool against my chest. Eo’s hair lies
within. Focus on that. On the way her hair moved. Drifting on deepmine
winds. Focus there. Thinking of her, I am beset with guilt. I like this life.
No matter my reluctance to play the Gold, no matter the sorrowful excuses I
make, part of me is like them. Perhaps I was born to be of two Colors.
      Slag that. Man wasn’t born to be any Color. Our rulers decided that.
And they were wrong.
      “Audentes fortuna juvat, darlings,” Sevro says over a private comline.
I burst out laughing at the Latin.
      “More ‘Fortune favors the bold’ crap? Why not just say carpe diem?”
      “Because it’s tradition to say …”
      “Do you boys always flirt like this before battle? It is adorable,”
Victra adds.
      “You should have seen them at the Institute, love at first howl,”
Mustang laughs.
      “I saw the clips! What a lovely couple.”
      I hear the smile in Mustang’s voice. “They even wore matching
garments. Stylish, weren’t they, Roque? And smelly.”
      “I certainly took no notice.”
      “Why not?”
      “Sevro scared the piss out of me. I wasn’t looking at what he was
wearing,” Roque replies, drawing laughs. “I thought he’d been bitten by a
squirrel and contracted rabies somehow.”
      “Roque?” Sevro calls sweetly.
      “Sevro.”
      “Hello.”
      “Hello?”
      “Next time I see you, I’m going to bite you.”
      “I must go.” Roque’s light laughter fades. “We’re engaging the main
enemy element.”
      “What are you going to do, bore them to death with a light poetry
reading?” Sevro again.
      “You’re a pricklick,” Roque declares playfully. “May the Furies guide
your swords and the Fates bring you home. Till then, my love is with you
all.”
      The profession of love startles the Golds. Roque’s com clicks off and
we can hear him on the main frequency giving orders to attack an enemy
destroyer.
      “What a Pixie,” Sevro mutters, but even a child could catch the tremor
in his voice. He’s afraid.
      “Hic sunt leones,” I say to my friends. “I’ll see you on the other side.”
      “Hic sunt leones,” they echo, not for Augustus, but because we wish
we were brave as lions.
      One by one, we say our goodbyes. Before I can stop myself, I hail
Mustang’s private frequency. It takes her twenty seconds to answer. “What
is it?” Hesitation haunts her voice.
     “Stay alive,” I say.
     A pause. Emotion? Annoyance?
     “You too.”
     She closes the com link. Soon the gears begin to whir and click as I’m
loaded into the firing mechanism of the tube.
     I’ve acted this whole time like I know what’s coming. Like I know
what the Iron Rain is. But it looms before me like some dark, slavering
beast. A mystery, though I’ve seen its face. I’ve seen the virtual reality
experientials and HC clips. I know what it is the way a child knows flying
from watching a bird.
     “Deployment coordinates reached.” Roque’s voice fills the ears of
every Gold in the fleet. “Execute Operation Eagleburn.”
     The whine of the magnetic charge in the tube fills me. I slide forward
into the chamber, bracing myself, looking down so I don’t snap my neck.
Then it fires and I am claimed by velocity and battle as my stomach fills my
throat with bile. I rip through the magnetic stream, out of the ship’s tube
into swarming chaos.
     Fire and lightning rule space. Behemoths of metal belch missiles back
and forth, silently pounding one another with all the weapons of man. The
silence of it, so eerie, so strange. Great veils of flak explode around the
ships, cloaking them in fury, almost like raw cotton tossed into the wind.
RipWings and wasps buzz at one another, pissing streams of gunfire. They
nip and slice at carapaces of metal, fighting in a dense giant clouds. In little
packs they slip from their chaotic fights, spiraling silently toward clusters of
leechCraft as the destroyers and carriers launch their troop transports across
space in undulating waves. It’s a game of boarding parties. Over, under, and
through the curtains of flak the leeches go, seeking a hull to clamber onto so
they can pump their deadly cargo into the belly of crucial ships, like flies
dropping larvae into open wounds. All flown by Blues raised to do only this
one thing. Bellona craft pass those of Augustus, waves overlapping,
breaking on one another.
     All in silence.
     Missiles leap toward the leeches, wracking hulls with detonations. No
flames save where ships are punctured, leaking oxygen flames like
harpooned whales of Old Earth would gout blood. Railgun discharges
streak through space, tearing through multiple leeches and smaller fighters
at the same time, rending holes in the ranks. Ships rupture forth men and
women as both sides target engines, hoping to cripple and capture instead of
destroy. Amidst the blue and silver enemy fleet, the massive Warchild
shatters corvettes and torchShips like a cyclops wading through sheep—
club swinging pendulous and slow.
     I hold my breath as Victra’s destroyer, shielded by two others, slips
towards the Warchild. She’s strafed by railguns, and men-of-war garland
her with missile fire. The Bellona must warrant she’s too close to capture,
because they open another salvo into her softened belly. Yet amidst the fire
she suffers, the corvette births out a desperate burst of forty leechCraft.
Nearly ten times her normal complement. We carved her hollow to fit in the
additional troop carriers. That is the war party of the Telemanuses.
     Victra’s ship cuts away from the Warchild, recklessly plunging into the
Bellona formation where her mother’s flotilla of ships bearing the bleeding
sun support the Bellona eagles. Victra springs her second surprise.
     Her mother switches sides, betraying the Bellona as Victra promised
the Jackal and me. Her mother’s ships unload more than two hundred
leeches amidst the core of the Bellona fleet. It is chaos.
     My Titans land on the hull of the enemy flagship, and soon the
Warchild is festooned with leeches. Good luck, Titans.
     Bellona-friendly leechCraft redirect toward the Warchild to lend aid to
the battle that’ll clutter her halls with smoke and blood. RipWings zip past,
shooting the landed leeches, trying to skin them off before they dump their
men into the Warchild’s body. It is an elegant dance of action and reaction
and reaction and reaction.
     I carry on my trajectory, unable to alter it. To my left and right streak
thousands Golds and Obsidians in armored starShells, Grays in hivepods of
twelve each. A rain of men and metal. Amidst our current fly large storks
packed with more Obsidians and Grays. Once we make landfall and secure
the beachheads, the massed legions will slip out of the dreadnoughts and
carriers on landing craft and pour out behind us.
     Despite what the Bellona and their allies think, they cannot stop us
from landing men—the orbit around the planet is too large. That is why
holding the cities is of such importance. They are island fortresses. The
only realistic way of seizing them is making landfall and slipping under the
two-hundred-meter gap between their disc-shaped shields and the ground.
That requires men on the surface. Millions of men in coordinated assault.
      We will establish a hundred beachheads, and then our battle will begin
in earnest. In the chaos, missiles streak for our starShells. Friendly capital
ships deploy screens of flak behind us, and wasps cover our flanks. Enemy
wasps manage to swoop in from the sides, strafing us. Dozens in the rain
die around me, their armor folding back like burning paper. I hate this. I
want to scream. Some do and we have to cut off their coms.
      There is nothing I can do. Pray I don’t die. Pray my friends don’t die.
But pray to what? The Golds have no God. We Reds have an Old Man in
the Vale. But he does not help us in this life. He merely waits to shepherd
and guard us in the next.
      My heart rattles in my chest. Hyperventilating. Tearing out of my own
skin. I feel a boy. I want the comfort of home. Mother’s blood soup, the
touch of her stern hand, the love that flashed in me whenever I managed to
make her smile. Anything to feel the joy of realizing Eo loved me. I long
for the cold, quiet nights before love when it was only lust and hunger,
where we would kiss in secret, hearts fluttering, like two little birds
realizing they might build a nest together after all. That was what life was
supposed to be. Family. First loves. Not falling through atmosphere where
killers care for nothing more than to fill your body with hot metal before
moving on to kill your friends.
      My mind flees even as my body acts.
      The planet grows and grows till it is a swollen colossus that consumes
my vision. I do not know who is dead, who is alive. My display is too busy.
We hit the atmosphere and sound roars back. Halos of color cocoon my
trembling form. To my left and right, the falling soldiers look like raging
lightning bugs jerked out of some Carver’s fantasy. I admire the one to my
left. The bronze sun is behind him as he falls, silhouetting him,
immortalizing him in that singular moment—one I know I shall never
forget—so that he looks like a Miltonian angel falling with wrath and glory.
His exoskeleton sheds its friction armor, as Lucifer might have shed the
fetters of heaven, feathers of flame peeling off, fluttering behind. Then a
missile slashes the sky and high-grade explosives christen him mortal once
again.
      The moment we clear the atmosphere, surface gunfire screams up at
us, carving holes through our falling swarm. Like a beehive struck, we
activate our gravBoots and fracture into a thousand different squadrons,
each trying to follow its own coordinates. Enemy ripWings followed us into
the atmosphere, but here we’re more maneuverable, and we kill the big
fighters with ease. I swoop in on one from behind with the Howlers hot on
my tail, and slash it with my razor. I fly off as it spirals down through the
clouds into the ocean below.
      Antiaircraft fire screams up at us through the clouds and kills the Gold
to my right—a Howler, though I don’t know which till I look at my
datapad. Daria the Harpy is dead. Just like that. No sacrifice to save another.
No howl of rage at the end. No noble gesture. No emotion. The loyal girl
who wore belts of scalps at the Institute, who held Rotback and Screwface
in thrall to her strange devices, is gone.
      A stab of panic goes through me and I dive through the clouds with the
rest of my legion’s vanguard. We streak low over the ocean, where two
waterships spit up fire. Sevro sends two missiles slithering through the air;
they detonate, turning into a dozen micro missiles, which become another
dozen each. The ships detonate like corn kernels over fire.
      War is chaos. It always has been. But technology makes it worse. It
changes the fear. At the Institute, I feared men. I feared what Titus and the
Jackal could do to me. You see death coming there and can at least struggle
against it. Here you don’t have such luxury. Modern war is fearing the air,
the shadows, fearing the silence. Death will come and I won’t even see it.
      I slam down on a snow-covered mountain. Clouds of vapor rise as I
melt a hole in the white from the heat of my red-hot suit. The rest of my
squad lands around me, finding safe harbor on the ground. Roaring down,
meteor men from metal monsters. Thump. Thump. Thump. And the fog of
war rises.
      “Landfall,” I snarl.
      Sevro falls to a knee, pops open his helmet, and pukes into the snow.
Others join him. Ugly Screwface gasps in sadness. Rotback grips his
shoulder. Clown stands guard over them, his red-painted Mohawk sideways
on his head. Harpy doesn’t exist anymore. I didn’t know it would be like
this. I thought I knew horror. I didn’t. More men died in the last minute than
I’ve ever even known. Lorn’s fear of war quakes through me.
      This is war. Chaos. Chance. Death.
      Sevro nods to me, wiping puke from his mouth. Jupiter helps him
stand. Strangely, Sevro lets him. I look for Mustang’s signature on my
helmet’s datapad. She’s alive with the main element of my force, but we’ve
been separated. I’m with a dozen Golds and forty Obsidians specially
trained in hi-tech military equipment.
      “Exos off,” I bark at the Obsidians. “Omega, guard the perimeter.”
      We shed our clunky exo thermal armor to reveal the more agile
starShells beneath. I order helmets up. Metal demon and animal faces
replace those of friends.
      But there’s beauty in this moment. In the half seconds where Golds
and Obsidians nod to one another to pass on comfort before going about
their tasks, finding solace in the cocoon of duty, in companionship, like I
did in the mines.
      I gather Sevro to me along with the Howlers. Ragnar, separated from
his legion, stands in my shadow. We landed on the day-side of the planet. It
looks like a meteor shower as the second wave of starShells pierces the
atmosphere, leaving trails of black smoke across the fire-scarred blue sky.
Hundreds of ground cannons still shoot at the swarm that spreads from
horizon to horizon, but slowly those gunstreams thin as the guns are
targeted from space or eliminated by squads like us on the ground. My
squad is three hundred kilometers from where we need to be. How did that
happen?
      I call Mustang over the coms. She’s fifty kilometers closer to the
designated drop zone on some other mountain. Her force is nearer four
hundred men.
      “Looks like we’re the idiots,” Sevro says.
      We go down the mountainside. We do not fly. Instead, we skip. In the
Academy they taught us to think of it like skipping a rock over the surface
of the water. We could fly in our gravBoots, but flying makes you a target to
missiles and anti-air munitions, not to mention enemy hunting parties. So
we jump fifty meters in the air, then use our gravBoots to jerk us back
toward the ground.
      Missile fire comes from a nearby peak. Sevro and his squad deal with
it, skipping over thousand-meter ravines, skimming up the side of a steep
rock façade as Ragnar and I press forward. A dull thump echoes over the
mountain range as they rid us of the missile turret. The Howlers link up
with us at the end of the mountain range. We perch on the side of a cliff,
where low clouds gather. To the left, about twenty kilometers off, rise the
towers of distant whitewashed Thessalonica, perched on the craggy
coastline of the clear Thermic Sea. Tactus’s home. I feel a pang of sadness.
      We press north. I watch the towers fade, till they’re nothing but
glinting metal against the coast of that weirdly calm water. Explosions
rumble in the distance. I feel the weight of a hand fall on my armored
shoulder.
      “Just like after we took Olympus.” Sevro grins, looking down from a
new mountain’s peak at the land that lies open before us.
      “Except everyone has gravBoots here.” I check our coordinates in my
helmet’s HUD. The invasion continues above us. Enemy gunships, rarer
now, flit across the sky. One targets us. It roars through a cloud and chews
up the ground with chainguns. We take cover in a ravine. Snow kicks up
around us. Then a missile slithers out and collapses a rock onto my legs in
the explosion, pinning me down. Pebble and Clown stand over my body,
shielding me.
      “Ragnar!” I shout. “Kill it!”
      I don’t see what he does, but the sound is tremendous as the gunship
smokes and spins from the air, teetering toward the ground, and then
disappears in a cloud of shrapnel.
      “Your legs?” Sevro asks frantically.
      They pull the rocks off me. Gears groan and electrical components
whir.
      “Still work.”
      We descend the snowy mountain range into rugged Martian plains. A
mass of heavy infantry like us moves to our left. Their transponders label
them ours. But far off to the right, about thirty kilometers out, where the
ground swells into subtropical highlands, a Bellona column skips forward—
maybe three hundred in separate parties.
      “Cracked one of our com sigs,” a Green communications director in
space relays over a new signal. “They’re hunting you, Icarus.” My
secondary call sign.
      “Here’s when we learn who is winning the heavens,” I say. Sevro
directs a tracking laser on the enemy squad, just as they set one on us.
Theirs bobs on the ground in front of us like a frantic fly. We scatter, Sevro
and I flying away together, and then a rain of fire descends on our enemy
from two trajectories. At the same moment, Sevro IDs a drone deploying
cluster missiles at us. He tags it, and a railgun from nearby Thessalonica
fires a projectile that leaves a streak of blue fire across the horizon. The
drone disappears in a blossom of red. This is the multi-madness of hi-tech
war.
      We make our way to Mustang’s coordinates, sensors and eyes peeled
for the death that hides in the mountains. It stalks the plains. It secrets itself
in woods of towering godTrees and in the waters of the infant seas.
      A great lake stretches far to our left, while a dormant volcano so
gradual in its incline that it seems little more than a snow-capped hill
broods to our right. I soar higher along the spine of the mountain range we
traverse to gain vantage over the surroundings. Periodic topographical data
flickers onto my datapad as drones broadcast data, are shot from the sky,
then replaced.
      It is quiet inside my suit. I cannot hear the wind that whistles around
me at this great height. A stormcloud, one of Mars’s dramatic thunderheads,
rolls in from the distant lake. When it hits the forest below the mountain,
the rains come and the lightning slashes the sky. Atop the craggy peak,
snow swirls, melting against my suit.
      I catch movement on a peak nearby. I hold off on discharging my
weapon when I see it’s no Bellona, but a carved beast. I magnify my vision
and see the griffin clinging to the edge of a huge nest set into a narrow stone
defile atop the peak, watching in wonder as men fly across her valley
below. What a world these Golds have built.
      My men rejoin me on the next peak over, pausing a moment to check
the powercells in our starShells. They won’t last all day. Mustang’s group
slams into the ground around us, causing snow to scatter as four hundred
starShelled killers add their strength to ours. She bumps fists with me.
      “Icarus?” a voice crackles in my ear. “Icarus, do you read me?”
      “Roque, I read. What’s what?”
      “Icarus … urgent … on … read me?” His signal breaks up as lightning
slashes overhead. Jamming devices from both sides already molest the
airwaves. “Dar … ead … me … in Agea.”
      “Roque? Roque?” I know the plan for the battle above, but the tone of
his voice worries me.
      “Coms are all scattered,” I tell Mustang.
      “Local frequencies are fine. It’s the jammers and storm.” Rain
splatters over her faceplate.
      Sevro points up. “Gonna have to get your ass above it to hear.”
Above, a ship is struck by lightning. Her systems fail and she plummets
before reactivating, only to collide with a passing ripWing.
     “Oh, goryhell.” I give Ragnar and Jupiter orders to push forward of the
mountain range and secure the northern valley for our main force of Gray
legions. While we besiege other cities to divert Bellona attention, to me
Agea is all that matters. A million men will go at her walls. The Stained
opens his hand to me in salute and then jumps off the mountain peak with
Jupiter and a hundred Obsidian warriors.
     Mustang and Sevro wait below as I rip up through the lightning-laced
clouds with several of my bodyguards. Past the clouds, I float in relative
peace, hailing Roque.
     “Icarus!” he shouts into the com. “She’s here. She’s not on Luna or
with the main Societal fleet! We just found out. Kavax’s men found
Praetorians on board the Warchild … she’s here! She came in secret
without her fleet; we caught her.”
     “Roque. Slow down. What are you saying?”
     “Darrow, the Sovereign is on Mars. Her shuttle is trapped behind the
shields on Agea. She is trapped.”
     “Roque. I already know. She’s why I want Agea.”
39
At the Wall

      He doesn’t ask how I knew. Later I’ll tell him that I let Aja escape
from Europa so we could track her back to the Sovereign via my bomb’s
radiation signature. She’s her personal killer. Of course she would return to
her side. I’ve told no one but Mustang and Sevro. I couldn’t risk it
spreading, especially with how Roque’s been acting.
      He hangs up the com without another word.
      The vanguard of my force, Ragnar’s men, have made landfall in the
valley ahead. I see the fat ships descending, then disappearing into the
ground where the Valles Marineris stretches kilometers beneath. We have
our Blues in space lay fire down on Agea itself. The deluge heats the shield,
causing it to pulse opaque. We’ll be coming at her at ground level along the
bottom of the hundred-kilometer-wide canyon from the north and south,
just through the two-hundred-meter gap her shields must maintain above
soil to avoid creating seismic disturbances.
      I hop off the mountain peak at the head of my bodyguard. Sevro and
Mustang accompany me as we jump to another peak, then skip through the
lower foothills, taking fire as we go.
      The Sovereign is the key to this war, the key to fracturing this Society
so the Sons of Ares can rise. With her captured, the Society itself will
wonder in confusion if it even exists without Octavia atop its throne.
Senators and governors will try to seize power. There will be a dozen local
wars, fracturing manpower and cohesion.
      Beneath me, a world of bounty lounges along the bottom of the vast
canyon—lakes and streams, waist-high grasses, trees blooming with
flowers and Spartan pines growing at odd angles from the kilometers-high
canyon walls despite the steep declivity. Above all this, the great floating
mountain, Olympus, reigns. I glimpse the quiet castles and see deer running
in the vale of Mars. But I see no children along the great rivers, no boys and
girls in armor. Only memories and muddied earth. The students have
already been collected. How strange that must have been—fighting for their
lives with medieval weapons, only to be scooped up by dropships as
invaders came from space.
     We meet with Jupiter and Ragnar on one of floating Olympus’s white
spires. There are dead men in the halls, on the slopes.
     “They used it as a base,” Jupiter says cheerily. “Your Stained disagreed
with their presumptuousness. I like the beast!” Our men secure the section
of the Valles Marineris set aside for the Institute, far east of Agea in the
upper arm of the grand canyon. I watch out the window as hundreds of
friendly dropships descend on the staging ground, depositing more than
three hundred thousand men in thirty minutes. A Gold runs out of each
lowered ramp, always the first onto enemy soil.
     “No resistance,” I say quietly, my starShell helm popped. I look at
Mustang uneasily.
     She wipes blonde hair from her eyes. “The longer we’re dug in, they
harder we are to dislodge. Why are they waiting?”
     “Want to cluster us up like a bunch of grapes before stomping,” Sevro
guesses. “Atomics?”
     “Silly children.” Jupiter goes through the pockets of one of the dead
men. “That’s why we have Grays. Let them be stomped. They will lubricate
our passage.”
     “No atomics,” Mustang says. “Sensors would have picked them up
from a hundred clicks away.” She looks out over the land. “They’re waiting
because they don’t have enough men to contest our passage through the
valley. Or we’ve caught them flat-footed, which is doubtful. Or they
deployed too many men to halt Lorn’s advance. Or they’ve created choke
points in the valley. Or they marshal them around the Citadel. Or there’s a
trap ahead.”
     Her mind is a machine.
     “There’s a trap,” she says after a moment. “But they are over-relying
upon it to stall us while they reallocate men and materiel.” She snorts in
contempt. “Static defenses without massive mobile support haven’t been
relevant since the Maginot Line.”
     “But they know we don’t want to waste the city or the populace,” I say.
     “They know that.” Mustang adjusts her datapad, examining the map.
“Which shrinks our flexibility in tactics.”
     “Total war is easier,” Jupiter grumbles. “Let’s use the Grays to
lubricate our passage, then drop bombs at the walls under the shields. Entry
gained.”
     “It takes a day to break a city, then fifty years to rebuild,” Mustang
snaps. “You want to sign up to oversee the reconstruction?”
     “Do I look like a builder?” Jupiter asks.
     “The passage to Agea is eighty kilometers wide on average, seven-
kilometer-high walls on either side, all farming and agriculture for the city.
Bellona likely littered the place with mines. If they had time. We didn’t
exactly tell them we were coming.” Did they have time?
     Mustang motions me to the side.
     I walk with her away from the rest of my command staff, who roll
their eyes at one another. The airy palace halls should remind me of past
victory, but all I feel is steep melancholy being here. So many memories. So
many lost friends, I think when I see a Grays landing near Minerva castle
where Pax and I once dueled.
     “It’s eighty kilometers to the walls from here,” she says. “We could
make the dash as planned. Just because they didn’t contest our landing
doesn’t mean there’s something nefarious afoot.” She sees the hesitation in
my eyes. “We are here for my father just as much as we’re here for the
Sovereign. We have to move with pace.”
     “You’re afraid Lorn is going to kill him if he breaks through the
southern city walls first,” I guess. “Aren’t you.”
     “You know their history.”
     “I do.”
     “And do you trust Lorn not to finish an old grudge?”
     “Lorn isn’t a murderer.”
     “No. He hurts men who deserve it, like Tactus. My father deserves it as
much as any man. So we must hurry. And you must tell the rest of them
about the Sovereign.”
     “Roque found out. Praetorians on the Warchild.”
     We walk back and I address my small council.
     “You know we come here for Augustus, but there’s a second reason we
press on Agea. The Sovereign is here.”
     “No shit?” Clown mutters.
     Rotback scratches his head. “Goryhell.”
     “In the Citadel?” Pebble asks, excitedly nudging anxious Weed with
her knee.
      “In all probability. We traced Aja here. Residual radiation from the
bomb we hit her team with on Europa. The other assaults are designed to
draw manpower away from Agea so that we will have a chance to break
through her walls and capture Octavia before her Ash Lord arrives with the
full might of her armada.” And if the Sons have done their part as Ares
promised, we should be able to get into the city without fighting through a
hundred thousand armored men and women.
      “Is Cassius in the city?” Sevro asks.
      Mustang nods. “We think so.”
      Sevro smiles.
      “If you come upon Cassius, do not engange him,” I say. “Nor Karnus,
nor Aja.”
      “You’d have us run?” Clown asks, insulted.
      “I’d have you live,” I say. “The prize is the Sovereign. Don’t be
distracted by revenge, or pride. If we seize her, we are the new power in the
Solar System, my friends.”
      The Howlers share wolfish grins. Sevro squares his shoulders.
      “So lets stop picking our butts.”
      “Couldn’t have said it better myself.”
      Friendly ripWings roar overhead to clear out enemy forces along our
path.
      With all our powers marshaled, we move through the green canyon.
No creeping column. We go fast. Speederbikes have more pace than
starShells. Those Grays and the ones on spiders tear ahead after the
ripWings and heavily armored dropships that will deposit men even closer
to the wall. Flashes ahead indicate they’ve detonated mines or the mine
killers have done their job. No way to tell. The canyon here is narrowing.
Verdant canyon walls tower hugely in the distance to either side, colossal
and unreal, like the terrain of a greater, larger race than man. I can’t see all
my force in so vast a place, just the tip of the spear. We come after the fast-
moving Grays, a skipping column of dreadful knights in starShells of black.
The deluge of rain falls even harder. Behind us roll tanks and the infantry
columns in their hover skiffs, lightly armored vehicles that can carry a
hundred men in a flatbed. They’ll deposit them a kilometer from the walls.
Lorn’s attack from the south will be much similar.
      “Drones!” Sevro shouts through the com. A cloud of metal rises
toward us from a small depot in the canyon wall to the east. The Howlers
streak after the threat, their guns ripping holes in the air. Still, dronefire
shreds a squad of flying Obsidians. They plummet to the ground, bodies
unrecognizable. We skim over buildings now. Small towns. Resorts.
Estates. Granaries. We find ourselves over a lake. See our shadows as
lightning flashes above, silhouetting us.
      I see the defensive wall now. It falls over the horizon like an iron
curtain. Ninety kilometers across, at this stage of the canyon, and nearly
two hundred meters high, it nips the lower edge of the shield. Lakes and
rivers don’t find their terminus here, but instead run beneath the wall
through a thick network of durosteel bars that are strong as a ship’s hull. It
would take a hundred men ten hours to drill their way through those bars.
      Most cities do not have walls so massive. They cost too much. Agea
and Corinth are alone in the quality of their fortifications. We could have
come through the tunnels that wend through the belly of Mars and connect
every city with their mines, but I didn’t want to. There are tactics I must
save. And there is an example I must set.
      Assaults like this are not protracted things. I’ve seen the histories.
They are wild and manic. Technology against static objects always wins, so
long as the besieger’s resolve never runs dry. Once upon a time, castles
were nearly impossible to take through direct assault on a capable garrison
without the price of Pyrrhic victory. So field armies laid siege and starved
defenders into submission. Now, no one has the patience.
      Agea is a city of twenty million souls, but how many of those will give
a lick who wins today? There is no difference between the rule of the
Bellona and the rule of the Augustus. Coppers and Silvers will care. But the
Reds, the Browns, the Pinks will just watch another master take the chains.
      Now they’ll see ships fill the sky. Bombs rupture the air. And they will
huddle in their public tenements and fear faceless marauders. Since the
dawn of man, the taking of a city has been echoed by the screams of rape,
theft, drunken horror. Peerless Scarred do not partake in such savagery. It is
not profitable nor in keeping with their tastes. But if one takes a city by
force, it is the belief of the Golds that the city and all those therein are now
property of the conqueror. If you are strong enough, you deserve the spoils.
Some spare the spoils. Some let them to the wolves, feeding cities to their
Obsidian and Gray armies as reward for blood spilled.
      If I can protect this city of Agea, if I can show them that there is a
better breed of man, then just maybe I’ll win Agea’s heart. Capture it.
Protect it. Be loved by those in it as I’m loved by my army. But first I must
crack her open.
      All along the vast defensive wall, fire ripples over steel. Like tiny
flowers fast blooming upon the ninety-kilometer-wide sheer gray wall. Two
feint assaults are led to my left and my right. The ripWings there fire
railguns, sliding sideways as they pump munitions at the wall. Return fire
from the turrets on the walls causes my eardrums to shiver and hum. I want
to clutch Mustang’s hand. A nod from her stills the terror in me. But only
just.
      Grays in combat armor rush forward like so many ants. Rocket teams
deploy and soon send slithering death into the defenders. It is too much to
absorb, like the space battle above, layers upon layers of activity and
counter-activity. Except this has sound.
      Mines rip holes in my force. Bellona kill squads slip out of the wall a
hundred meters up, flying out in glory—banners waving, gold glistening.
Their shields shimmer as they’re lanced by weapon fire. I see an eagle
banner amidst the Bellona, and ready to set myself against it, thinking it
must be Cassius, but Mustang grabs my arm.
      “The plan!” Mustang reminds me, pointing to the river. “We’ll all die
against that wall. The plan.”
      Hard to remember. Hard to remember all this chaos is a distraction.
What matters is the river and the work done in the night by the Sons. If they
did it. The river slithers under the wall. One hundred meters wide, and more
deep, it already carries corpses toward the city.
      I dive into the water. Feel the tension as the current slows, then speeds
my path. Fish scatter before us. Odd not feeling the chill. The Howlers
move like torpedoes beside me. Then Ragnar is with us and his group of
Obsidians. Jupiter too, all splashing down under water. Mustang is closest
me. I scan the river ahead through the murk we kicked up and find Ares’s
gift.
      There. A hundred meters deep, I see it. If there’s one things Reds can
do, it’s drill. And the Sons spent the night preparing to give us passage into
the city. My men will think some elite lurcher squad was sent here before
the armada. They will not question how the huge grates were cut, or how
the sensors meant to detect damage to the grating were fooled.
      “Once more unto the breech,” I murmur, as if Roque, Victra, or Tactus
could hear me. I activate my gravBoots and move forward.
      The passage is narrow as it curls beneath the wall near the bottom of
the riverbed. We travel two abreast. So I take the best fighter with me,
Ragnar, as we move first through the underwater passage. My com crackles
with news of the battle above. We’re losing at the wall.
      Ragnar and I clear the tunnel together. I half expected a Bellona
ambush, but none comes. The Sons did their job well. We wait on the
opposite side of the wall, still submerged, one hundred meters down at the
bottom of the riverbed. The rest of my cadre join Ragnar and me—
Mustang, Sevro, and the remaining Howlers. Fifty more Golds and three
times that many Obsidians and Grays.
      I speak into my com when we’ve all gathered at the bottom of the
river. “You know your orders.”
      Sevro bumps armored fists with me. Mustang does the same. Ragnar
salutes with his fist balled and against his heart. Jupiter yawns into his com.
Clown, Pebble, and Weed rile up the Howlers, stirring silt at the bottom of
the river. The seconds tick by. My razor is looped about my arm. PulseFist
in my left hand. Feel the thump of my heart and the chill of the pendant on
my chest. Hear the crackle of chaos outside. My Helldiver hands ball. My
eyes close. Sevro sends up a probe to see if the riverbank is safe.
      I’m to find the Sovereign.
      Ragnar is to open the gates.
      Mustang is to lower the shield so Roque can send reinforcements and
we can take the city in one fell swoop. I don’t want her to leave me, but I
can trust no one else with the task.
      Trust. I must trust that she will live, trust that her Obsidians will
protect her, and that she will protect herself. There’s a weight pressing
down on my heart, a fear that she will not come back. It feels like she’s
already falling into darkness. If she dies, she’ll die believing a lie. I promise
myself I’ll tell her if we survive this. She deserves that much.
      Stay alive. Stay alive. All of you, stay alive.
      Mustang departs, moving further down river, following it for
kilometers till she reaches the park near the generators. I watch her go and
flounder for something to hold on to, someone to pray to. My father is with
me, and so is Eo. I feel them in the beating of my heart.
      I close my eyes.
      Sevro gathers the probe he sent above and tells me that we are clear,
just a girl playing in the mud above us.
      “Fight for each other,” I say over the com to those at my side in the
riverbed. “On me.” We activate our gravBoots and soar through the water,
bursting through the surface of the river like inky monsters, our black
starShells dripping as we fly up over the riverbank, muddy from rain that
fell before the shields were raised to protect the city. Beneath us, a single
unarmored Brown girl stands, ankle deep in the mud. I stare at her from
behind my terrible black helm. She should be hiding with her family, not
out in a besieged city. Something is wrong.
      When she sees us, she snatches from a basket a small globe device.
Lightning slashes the sky. Her best dress gathers mud on the hem, turning
an even deeper brown.
      “Shoot her!” Sevro snarls.
      I knock his hand aside. A tree explodes instead. And as I look high
above where, on the wall, far out of range of the probe Sevro sent up, and
far beyond the limits of the EMP globe the girl carries, perch Bellona
knights and their Obsidian retinue. Waiting.
      The girl presses a button on the globe.
      And that’s when we begin to die.
PART IV
 RUIN
 Rise so high, in mud you lie.
  —Karnus au Bellona
40
Mud

      The EMP detonates. Sounds like a giant child gasping when pricked
by a needle. Our electronics die. Our gravBoots sputter. StarShell synapses
fail, causing the massive metal suits to be gripped by gravity. We plummet
down. Most fall into the mud of the riverbank. I splash into the water.
Sinking. Sinking. Ears popping. Down and down till I lodge into the mud of
the river bottom. Hitting hard. Legs buckling under the weight of my
starShell. Fall on my back. Can’t see my men. Only saw shapes moving
over the surface of the water as I fell. Now too deep to see anything except
how the river darkens with blood. Occasional lightning flashes silhouette
fast-sinking bodies.
      I can’t move. My starShell is too heavy. I lie like a turtle, half stuck in
mud at the bottom of the river. Confused. Fear rides in me. It happened so
fast. Can’t even look to my left or my right to see who is with me. My com
is dead. If it weren’t, I’d probably hear screams, curses.
      This starShell brought me from space to land. A life raft, a personal
castle in the middle of a war. Now it’s my coffin.
      Heart thudding. Want to scream.
      Hyperventilating. Terror traps itself in my chest, tensing me, making
me swallow the air, eating it as though it’ll give me power to move. Slow
down. Slow down. Think. Think. Two bodies sink near me. Heavy in their
armor, they fall fast to join the others on the bottom. No grace in death,
spilling blood as they go. When the killers finish with those stuck in the
mud of the riverbank, they’ll come for us down here. But they don’t need
to. I slow my breathing. Limited oxygen left in the suit. Recycler offline.
      Cassius knew my plan. It had to have been him. Or was I betrayed?
      I told no one but the Sons and Sevro and Mustang. None of them could
have ratted. He just knew. That bloody bastard. If I could surrender, I
would. I’d save the lives of those with me. But I don’t have a com.
      I jerk my body around, trying to push myself off my back. But I’m too
lodged in the mud, and my suit is more than one ton of metal. I can’t shed
the weight. Can’t get the starShell off. I need the electronics for that. I push
up with my arms. Nothing. The mud swallows me. Mustang got away. I
think. I hope. Will she know we’re down here?
       I look for Sevro, for Ragnar, my Howlers. Dark shapes around me. I’m
dizzy. Slow the bloodydamn breathing. Slow. Think. They won’t even
bother coming to kill me. I’ll die at the bottom of the river, staring up at the
surface as one by one, my friends fall down to join me. So alone. Sevro.
Ragnar. Pebble. Weed. Clown. They’re dead. Dying. Watching the same
thing as me. Or maybe they’re on the bank as the Bellona walk amongst the
paralyzed suits of armor, killing at will. I want to cry at my impotence.
       Stop. Do something. Move.
       “Rise so high, in mud you lie.” It echoes in memory.
       This is the third time they’ve left me in the muck and mire to die. I grit
my teeth till I feel enamel crumble off as I put all my strength into moving
my right arm. Slowly, so slowly, it makes an exodus from the sucking
pressure of the mud. But it is all that’s freed. I won’t be able to get off my
back. I’m too sunken in. Too heavy in the shell. Then I see it. When the
EMP blast detonated, it shut down the electrical synapses, which means the
suit froze, but the razor still works, and there it is like a white python
around my arm.
       It will save your life for the price of a limb. Those are the words they
told me when they put the slingBlade in my hand as a boy. Salvation is
sacrifice. The razor’s impulse is chemical. Its switch will respond to me. It
will straighten. But around my arm … I have to be fast.
       Taking a breath, I close my eyes, feeling the toggle against my suit’s
thumb. I have to be faster than a licking flame. Faster than a pitviper. I flick
the switch on.
       The razor tightens as it straightens, slicing through metal like a knife
through pudding.
       Flick the switch off. It stops as it bites through muscle, but not through
bone. I yelp at the terrible pain in my forearm. Water rushes through the
shredded arm to cool the burning wound.
       Then I feel terror. Water. I just opened my suit to water. Idiot. Soon
it’ll fill. I can already feel it slithering up my neck on the inside. In minutes,
two or three, I’ll drown. I work my bloody forearm arm free of the shredded
metal carapace and slide the slack razor off so it floats like a tentacle. Then
I activate it again. It forms into a deadly question mark and I angle it toward
the other gauntlet.
      My suit’s filled with water in the torso now. The air is thin. Each
breath brings more stars behind my eyes. A sensation of lightness as blood
seeps from the wounds on my arm. I can survive a long time holding my
breath. But I hyperventilated and now I’m sucking in carbon dioxide. But
then my other hand is free of the suit gauntlet. Bare and pale in the weird,
dark light. Gentle clouds of blood plume from it.
      If I were not made a Helldiver, I would die in this riverbed. As it is, I
skin off my starShell and the armor beneath. It is my dexterity that saves
me. I cannot move my head because of the weight of the helmet. Cannot see
where I cut. My skin and the pain it registers serve as my eyes. Inch by
inch, I remove myself from the starShell. Inch by inch, I drag the deadly
blade along my body. Shedding my blood and the shell into the water.
Parting the exoskeleton. I’m like a locust slipping from its dead husk. Very
delicately, I remove the helmet, cutting it off at the neck. I hold my breath,
and just nick my throat.
      A scratch. So close to the jugular.
      My legs are the last part of me I free. I sit up, the broken bits of my
suit scratching at my skin, and jerk my right leg out of the hewn metal. I’m
alive and wounded in the cold, dark river. Helmet off. Holding my breath as
spots bloom across my vision. Now I’m able to see the sunken field of men
around me at the bottom of the riverbed. I swim over to the largest one and
see Ragnar’s closed eyes behind his starShell’s faceplate. Tears trickle from
them. His lungs are large, but there can’t be much oxygen left in that suit.
He can move better than I could, because of his great strength. But no
armored man could swim in this water.
      I did not think he could cry. Yet now he weeps, silently. Not great,
dramatic tears. These are different, calm. And when he opens his eyes, I see
something else in him. Some dormant part of his soul ignites. He was dead,
had given in to his fate. Yet here I float in a tattered black tactical cloth,
bloody, looking positively deranged, but free of my shell. I’m his hope. I
start cutting, even though my own lungs are screaming. I need him. I can’t
search for Sevro. There’s no time. And I cannot surface just to be killed on
sight.
      I operate on him like a proper Carver, till he wrenches himself free of
his exoskeleton. Others have seen what we’re doing. But we cannot help
them yet. They must hold on.
      Ragnar and I kick our way through the rough current toward the
surface. Lungs starving. Ragnar’s pale, tattooed body moves through the
water with a grace I can’t match. I didn’t realize Obsidians were such
swimmers. Makes sense for one born near the ice floes.
      We’re near the surface when my mind loses to my body. Ten feet from
the surface, I inhale water.
      Darkness.
      Feel mud between my fingers. Something moves through my chest.
Water. I vomit it, hack it out into a rough hand clutched close to my mouth,
quieting me. I keep puking through the fingers. Then feel an explosion of
pleasure as I gasp finally for air. Beautiful air. Hand still covering my
mouth. And for a moment, there is nothing. Just the pure orgasm of life into
my lungs. The full sting of oxygen on empty, aching organs. And suddenly
the sound of distant warfare swells. And the groans of men. We’re in a field
of corpses. The wall towers high overhead. The river runs fast at our feet.
It’s been minutes since the EMP, but it seems the day has passed and left us
behind.
      Ragnar dragged me into the mud between two dead Obsidians. Two
Bellona Golds, six Obsidians, and six Grays walk along the dark riverbank,
finishing those who lie helpless. We’re lucky the rest have quit the slaughter
to return to the fight at the wall. Cassius will have led them away. That
means he didn’t know it was me here, but he was well aware of the hole
made by the Sons, at least. For me, he would have stayed. Lucky I didn’t
carry the banner Clown and Weed made for me. Double lucky I didn’t let
them wear their wolfcloaks.
      This mud is a graveyard. My soldiers are half buried. Some try to rise
in the heavy, dead armor, only to slip back into the mud or be kicked down
by the Golds and mercilessly butchered. Most lie quiet. A field of armored
beetles leaking red.
      The Grays joke to each other as they go methodically about their task,
taking their time on an Obsidian stuck on his back, using forcePikes to
pierce the thick starShell and pin him to the ground like boys tormenting a
stranded crab. They finish him eventually with armor-boring bullets called
diggers from their rifles.
      Ragnar gestures to the mud. Half naked, he and I cake ourselves in the
dark, heavy stuff. It cools the tracework lacerations on my body and covers
the tattoos on his. I gesture to one of the Gold helmets and mime our
survivors’ oxygen running out. Ragnar nods. I pull a razor from the body of
a dead Gold. I can’t tell who. And hand it to Ragnar. It’s only ever seen
Gold hands. No Praetorian, no Obsidian, not even one of those with badges
from the Sovereign herself, has touched this weapon since the Dark Revolt.
To touch it means death by starvation. No possibility of reaching Valhalla.
Only hunger and cold and the end. But our enemies will have pulseShields.
No other weapon will do.
     Ragnar drops it like it’s made of fire. I shove it back into his trembling
hands.
     “They aren’t gods.”
     Like shadows pulled from the Styx, we slide forward through the
graveyard. Our enemies are not in their fighting bands. Easy targets. I
scuttle forward on all fours like some horrible spider, hardly rising from the
ground to kill two Obsidians before they even turn. Ragnar snaps another’s
neck and cleaves a second in half, the recoilPlate peeling away. Rising from
my hands, I sprint at the tallest of the Obsidians, jump and bury my blade
into his body. I land poorly on my wounded arm. I don’t even feel the pain.
Too much adrenaline. I see the squad of Grays turning, so I fall with the
Obsidian’s body and roll into the mud, lying in shadow and filth amongst
the other corpses. Their recoilRifles and pulse weapons would rip me to
ribbons without my shield and armor. Ragnar’s disappeared too. I don’t
know where.
     Time ticks by. How much oxygen could they have left? The Grays
hunting us shout something about ghostCloaks. The remaining Obsidian
groups with the two Golds. Reluctantly, the Grays go through the bodies,
finishing my remaining men to flush Ragnar and me out for the Golds and
Obsidian. Lea died like this, down in the mud. Not again.
     I rise, not with a scream, not with a howl. Silently. Let them try to see
me coming. I am fast. And I’m nearly on them when they open fire. I rip
toward them, dodging, weaving, like a loosed balloon. No beauty to my
movement. Just frantic terror. I cannot see the bullets. Only feel their
closeness. Sense the heat of them ripping past me. Feel the punch as I’m hit
in the bicep. Shock through my body. The skin tears as the bullet goes
through flesh, tendon, muscle, then out the other side, knicking bone. I
grunt. And then I’m upon them, and they make no noise at all.
     They missed their window.
     Twelve enemies fall to Lorn’s kravat lessons. Twelve men and women.
     The Golds and Obsidian come upon me now. The Golds use their
gravBoots. Ragnar rises from the mud and hurls his razor through the air
like a spear. The huge Obsidian falls into the mud as Ragnar rushes the two
Golds, picking another razor from the ground.
     I marvel at his power. He grabs one of the Golds by the foot as they
pass in the air. The pulseShield electrocutes him, sending pain lancing
through his body. But he just roars, holding on, and with a scream coming
not from his throat, but his soul, he slams the Gold down to the ground like
he’s chopping wood. He somehow manages to rip the boot off. The lean
Gold rolls away, shouting, “Stained!” to his friend, who comes back to his
aid so they face off with Ragnar together.
     I run to Ragnar’s aid.
     “Reaper!” One of the Golds lets his helmet retract into his armor,
revealing the haughty face of a Peerless man. Confident in his rank. In his
heritage. In his place. His face is all joy. Then it contorts as he sees
Ragnar’s razor.
     “You give the blade of your ancestors to a dog?” He glares hate at
Ragnar. Then down at the razor, furious, confused. “Have you no honor?”
     I choose not to answer.
     “Know who you face, Andromedus,” the older Gold rages. “I am
Gauis au Carthus of gens Carthii. We built the Columns of Venus. We first
sailed the gaps between the Inner and Outer rims and mined the Helsa
Cluster.”
     “This isn’t The Iliad. Ragnar, kill this fool. We need his gravBoots.”
     The Gold spits. “You send a dog to do your fighting?”
     “I am a man!” Ragnar screams louder than the roaring engines of a
passing ship. Spittle flying, face ragged with rage. Veins rise in his neck. He
howls, rushing forward before I can even raise my blade. He picks up the
corpse of the fallen Obsidian and uses it to deflect their razors. He punches
Gaius. No weapon. Just his fist. He hits him so hard in the pulseShield that
the man falls backward. Then he kills the other, hacking through his
defenses with mad fury till he cuts him in half. He kicks the top of the
corpse aside and batters down Gaius, who sinks into the dark mud as
Ragnar thumps forward and, muscles twitching from having touched the
pulseShield, holds the razor to Golden man’s throat.
     “Yield to me and live,” Ragnar rumbles.
     Gaius spits.
      “Yield to me as a man yields to another man.”
      “Never.” Gaius’s lips curl sourly. He speaks his last words clear and
loud, with spite and courage. All that is good and all that is wicked in these
extraordinary people. “I am the Peerless Legate Gaius au Carthus. I am the
sum of humanity. So yield I do not. For a man cannot yield to a dog.”
      “Then become dirt.” Rangar pushes the blade home.
      We ferry our men from the bottom of the river. Fast as we can using
stolen gravBoots, but not fast enough. Sevro is not dead, but he’s close. I
find him buried headfirst in the riverbank. He’s cursing and spitting when I
peel him out with the help of Clown and Pebble.
      “The dead?” he asks quietly. “My Howlers?”
      “Too many,” Clown says thinly.
      “Did Mustang get through?”
      They all look at me.
      “I think so,” I say. “But I can’t hail her on any coms. We have to hurry
either way. If she is alive and she blows the generators so our
reinforcements can land, then the shield falls and the Sovereign has a wide
window to escape. Right now, she’s bottled up.”
      Sevro nods. Little Pebble gives him a hand up. Small Thistle, hardly
coming to Ragnar’s solar plexus, sees him with a razor in his hand as he
frees another Obsidian from a dead starShell. “Drop that,” she snaps.
      Ragnar drops it and looks to me in a strange panic. I motion him to
wait.
      After we go through the suits of those who fell on the riverbank, we
know the count, and it so devastating that Sevro walks away. Weed is dead.
Rotback is dead. Harpy died before we hit the ground. And many of the
new recruits are dead. Only Thistle, Clown, Screwface, and Pebble are left.
Eleven of the original fifty Obsidians remain.
      Pebble and Clown touch Weed’s face, their matching mohawks flat
against their heads as the rain soaks us all. Pebble claws at his chest, her
small hands hitting his heart as though that will bring him back. Thistle
goes to pull her away as Clown uses mud to straighten Weed’s matching
mohawk in death. Sevro cannot watch. I go stand beside him.
      “I was wrong about war,” he says.
      “I can’t do this without you.” After a desperate moment, “Are you with
me? Sevro?”
    He pulls back and wipes snot from his nose, muddying his face. Tears
make lines in the mud as he looks up at me, voice cracking like a child’s.
“Always, Darrow.”
41
Achilles

      There’s no time to mourn. My force decimated, we must divide still
further. My army outside the city hurls itself at impregnable walls,
expecting help from the inside. They’ve received none. My Legates will be
hailing my signal, wondering if I have died. Such a rumor could lose the
battle.
      I send Ragnar with the remnants of the Obsidians to open one of the
wall’s gates for my Legates who wait for us with thousands of Grays and
Obsidians in reserve.
      “I give you no Golds,” I tell Ragnar. “Do you understand what that
means?”
      “I do.”
      “This can be a beginning,” I say quietly. I bend, picking a discarded
razor from the sucking mud. “It is a man’s duty to choose his own destiny.
Choose yours.” I extend the razor to him.
      Ragnar looks back to the Obsidians. Their armor is battered from
extricating them from the suits. And they’re caked in mud. Smaller than he.
Some lithe and quiet. Others huge and shifting foot to foot with eagerness.
All with those black eyes and white hair. They arm themselves with
weapons taken from the Grays and Obsidian I killed. Hardly enough to go
around, and they’ll be little use if they run into Golds.
      Ragnar chooses. He extends a hand. Howlers prepare themselves
behind me, Thistle still eyeing him evilly. “I choose to follow you,” he says.
“And I choose to lead them.”
      I place the razor in his hand.
      “Darrow!” Thistle gasps. “What are you doing?”
      “Shut up,” Sevro snaps.
      “He can’t do that!” Thistle stomps forward and tries to rip the razor out
of Ragnar’s hand. He doesn’t let go. “Give it up. Slave. Give me the blade.”
She pulls her own razor out. “Give me the blade or I’ll cut away the hand
that holds it.”
      “Then I will cut you down, Thistle,” Sevro sneers.
      “Sevro?” Thistle turns back to him, eyes wide. She looks at me, at the
other Howlers who stand quiet, unsure of what just happened. “Have you
gone mad? It’s not his right. It’s ours. He doesn’t …”
      “Deserve it?” Sevro asks. “Who are you to decide that?”
      “I’m a Gold!” she shrieks. “Clown, Pebble …”
      Pebble remains silent. Clown tilts his head. “Darrow, what is this?”
      “It’s my army,” I say. “You remember the Institute. You remember
how I bleed for those who follow me. How I do not take the allegiance of
slaves. Why now are you surprised by this? Because it is real?”
      “It’s a slippery slope, is all.” Clown looks at the war around us. “Even
here.”
      “You’re right. It is.” I bend and find another razor cast in the mud. I
toss this one to another of the Obsidians, a nasty-looking woman half my
size. She holds it like it’s a snake, glancing up at me in fear. They are raised
believing we are gods. To be given Thor’s hammer … how would I hold it?
Sevro walks through the corpses and finds several more. He tosses these to
the Obsidians.
      “Don’t cut yourselves,” he says.
      “I’m counting on you. Go,” I tell them. They disappear, sprinting into
the swelling darkness toward back side of the colossal wall. I turn back to
the Howlers. “Is there a problem?” They all shake their heads quickly,
except Thistle.
      “Thistle?” Sevro asks.
      Clown nudges her. And grudgingly she shakes her head. “No
problem.”
      There is. She will not follow me after this. Already I feel my friends
turning from me. And they know not even a fraction of the truth. That is a
problem for another day.
      We must move fast. But we only have one pair of functional gravBoots
between us. I give those to Sevro. We try to see if he can lift us like I lifted
the Howlers on Olympus, but as we load onto the boots in chains, they
sputter and spark. Only able to carry his weight. Damaged somehow in the
fighting and the rescue. Bloodydamn.
      So it will be on foot. And we cannot be slowed.
      I point to the recoilPlate of those lucky enough to have it after the
starShell amputations. “Armor off.”
      “What?” Thistle sputters.
      “Armor. Off. Except scarabSkin.”
      “Unarmored against Praetorians?” Thistle howls. “Do you want us all
to die?”
      “We need to move fast. If the shield goes down before we get to the
Citadel, the Sovereign will slip away. If we do not capture her, she will have
a chance to regroup. She will join her Ash Lord. She will summon all of the
Society, and they will come here with ten times our number to crush us.
We’ll win the battle, lose the war.”
      “But if we take her …,” Sevro growls, coming to my side.
      “We’re talking about the Sovereign,” Clown says. “She’ll have
Olympic Knights. Praetorians …”
      “And?” Sevro asks. “We have us.”
      “Six of us.” Clown shrugs sheepishly when we stare at him. “I just
thought someone should point it out.”
      “We have fifteen kilometers to cover on foot,” I say. They nod. “My
pace.” Then they exchange worried looks and start taking off their armor.
“If you fall behind, find a place to hide.” One-third Earth grav. Bodies in
prime shape. This will still be hard. Especially with my arm savaged by my
own razor.
      Sevro saddles up to me as the Howlers strip away their armor. I can
hear their terror in the clinking of weapons and armor moved by shaking
hands, see it in the frenzied way they then rub mud on their faces to blacken
their aspects.
      “They’ve been with you from the beginning, Darrow.” Sevro looks
around the stormy park, at the distant Citadel and blaze of passing ships.
“We’re already half the number that took you from Luna. You might have
replaced Pax with Ragnar, but you can’t replace them. Or me.”
      “I thought you were with me.”
      “I’m your conscience. I follow your ass everywhere. So don’t be a
shithead.”
      “Registers. On me,” I shout.
      Armor shed, we set off silently. Only our razors and scarabSkin with
us. Wearing rubber-soled undershoes instead of gravBoots. We go along the
river, leaving the wall behind. Sprinting through acres of grassy parks and
woods that separate the wall from the city as mechanized war rages in the
distance. Ships roar past, making the tree branches shudder and leaves fall.
Ground trams flicker far to our right, shuttling soldiers to the front.
Explosions plume in the distance. Clouds consume the sky beyond the great
shield that overlaps the city. Explosions flash inside the clouds.
      Mustang will be nearing the shield generators now, if she’s alive. We
can only pray they did not find her small squad. If Cassius or his hunters
find her …
      It is a ragged pace, covering fifteen kilometers at a sprint. My side
stabs with pain. Muscles hunger for oxygen. And my right arm aches from
the bloody bullet wound in my bicep and the lacerations that bleed along
the bicep and wrist. I took half a pack of stims, so I can use the arm. The
pain doesn’t blind. It focuses. Keeps me from thinking of the dead.
      When we reach the edge of the woods, we do not stop to rest, but
sprint onto the commercial district’s paved streets, cutting through buildings
that tower over a kilometer up into the sky. We run through deserted
lowDistricts, the bazaar where winding corridors lead us through rough
streets and graffiti-stained walls. The occasional Brown or Pink or Red will
scuttle out of our way or peer at us through windows, from alleys. Even
here, in the center of their reign, I see the graffiti of Eo’s death. Her hair is
ablaze like the wounded fighters that streak across the sky beyond Agea’s
transparent shields. Someone pukes behind me. They don’t stop. The reek
of bile travels with us.
      Sevro flies back to us and lands beside me. “Platoon of Grays ahead.
Go south one block, then cut back to avoid.” Then he’s gone again. We
follow his instructions.
      Suddenly there’s movement in the sky and we slow to a jog to watch.
Pebble takes the opportunity to collapse onto the pavement, chest heaving.
High above, but still beneath the shield, a horde of shuttles ferry soldiers
from the smaller engagement on the southern wall, where Lorn fights,
toward the northern wall where Ragnar and his Obsidians have gone.
Dozens of shuttles full of reserves depart their dock in the hangars and ports
that lace the seven-kilometer-high rock walls of the Valles Marineris to the
east and west. Most of the barracks are there, as are the factories where
highReds slave away making armaments and commercial consumer goods.
We hide from the craft. Something has happened at the north wall. We take
off again. Pebble moans. Thistle gets her up, keeps her in gear.
      Sevro rejoins us minutes later, left arm hanging limp at his side. I eye
it. He ignores my concern. “Ragnar opened the gorydamn gates.” His face
splits into a smile. “Twelve of them in the wall’s face. Our boys are pouring
in. And …” He stands there grinning.
      “And what?”
      “And Ragnar killed the Wind Knight and almost cut down Cassius.”
      “An Olympic?” Clown gasps.
      “Cut him down in front of the entire army. The Obsidians in the army
are going absolutely manic.”
      Then Sevro is off and we push on. A squad of Gray policemen waylay
us. We take cover as their gunfire pocks the sidewalks, and then divert to an
alleyway to avoid them.
      Four kilometers until we reach our destination.
      Coughing and gasping, we stumble into the exterior of the Citadel’s
grounds. We hide in the trees there like some ragged pack of castaway
demons. Through the thin copse of woods and past a high wall, the Citadel
stands a network of spires. Not golden, but white laced with red and still
decorated with the lions of Augustus, though Bellona blue and silver
banners flap in the breeze overtop a lion weathervane. Their silver eagle
seems so proud till Sevro waves down to us from the weathervane and cuts
one of the banners free. They didn’t expect anyone to penetrate this far.
      Aside from its beauty, the Citadel is also a fortress. One I don’t want to
tangle with. We’d go room to room, and assuming it is not completely
empty of soldiers, be overwhelmed, pinned to its expensive red oak walls
and killed on its marble floors. It is not shielded, but a network of bunkers
lie far beneath it. I was worried that is where the Sovereign would be kept.
If she stayed there, this would turn into a siege. It would be days before we
dig her out, if we could at all. So I give her a path of escape. It all falls on
Mustang’s shoulders: the shield must go down at the proper time. Flush her
out.
      A decorative wall, one that’d usually be nothing more than a hop-skip
in gravBoots, bars us from the silent Citadel grounds. All around us is park.
Trees. Fountains. White squares where Golds and Silvers would have
afternoon tea, now empty. So silent here at the eye of the storm. Sevro flies
down to join me.
      “Can you lift us over the wall?” I ask.
      “Things are almost outta juice,” he grumbles. “Let’s try.” We hug one
another and he lifts me into the air, wincing and favoring his left arm. The
boots sputter and shiver out sparks. Twice we dip down. Then we’re over
the wall. I set down atop and Sevro dips down again to pick up the next
Howler. Moments later, his head appears at the top of the wall for a
moment, then vanishes as his gravBoots spark and whine. With one last
mechanical pop, the boots give out and Sevro and the Howler fall the ten
meters to the ground.
      A great boom thunders from across the city. Smoke rises distantly.
      Mustang did it.
      Above, the translucent shield that separated this world from the world
of ships fails. It wobbles and, distorting the fires in the city and the
lightning above like a corrupted mirror, shatters into prismatic mist. Or one-
eighth of it shatters; a flood of pent-up water falls down on that section of
the city in great gray sheets.
      “It didn’t work!” Pebble cries from the other side of the wall.
      But it did. One by one, the nexuses that cast the shield overload. It’s a
chain reaction as great sheets of water from the storm finally fall on Agea.
Roque, if he’s winning, will launch the reinforcements. The city is as good
as taken. And even now, the Sovereign will be extracted from the bunkers
by her bodyguards to make an escape from the lost planet. But the shuttle
pads are still two kilometers on the other side of the Citadel grounds. This
was all supposed to be different. I should be in my armor, a hundred
Obsidians behind me, a dozen of my best Golds. Instead, I lead a pack of
my friends into a meatgrinder. I need to change the paradigm, but I won’t
risk them. I glance down the wall at Sevro, who immediately recognizes the
look in my eyes.
      “No, Darrow,” he says. “Think of your mission!” He’s begging me,
jumping and clawing at the wall as I turn away. “Don’t do it, Darrow. Wait!
They’ll kill you!”
      I drop over the other side of the wall into the Citadel’s gardens.
      Some men have threads of life so strong that they fray and snap those
around them. Enough friends have paid for my war. This one’s on me.
      “DARROW!” he screams, horrible, desperate. “STOP!”
      I run faster than I have in all my life. The Sovereign will not escape
me. I did all this to catch her. Take her, break the Society. Take her, and the
stage is set. We will rise. We can win. I jump rows of shrubbery, sprint
around fountains, tear through rosebushes. Blood leaks down my arm. I do
not feel my body. I fly over the earth. SlingBlade in hand.
      There.
      I round a corner of the Citadel. Past a garden of roses lies a courtyard
of white scored black by the engines of personal yachts. Four lonely ships
sit in a landing zone that can hold a hundred. All the shuttles are black with
a giant gold crescent on their broad chassis, but the thickest of them, one
with larger engines and a reinforced hull, is the Sovereign’s. The others are
decoys, nearly as thick, nearly as armored. In the air, they are
indistinguishable.
      I’ve been seen on sensors, no doubt. Gray lurchers are coming for me.
Obsidian bodyguards have been loosed from some hidden barracks to kill
me. They’ll only catch me if I stop. And even as I examine the landing pad,
I do not break my stride. Oranges bustle around the black shuttles, prepping
them to launch. I’m not too late. But the door from the Citadel is far closer
than I to the ship.
      They come out in a rush. I don’t see her. Just purple capes swirling in
the rain and wind. They duck their heads into the gale, look upward at the
sky where Iron Rain entry trails glow behind the storm, making the dark
clouds look like steel heating slowly in the forge. My Titans come.
      The Praetorians hurry, running up a long ramp into the shuttle’s belly
with the Sovereign. I catch her face as she ducks into the ship’s belly. I see
Aja amongst her entourage. And Karnus. And Fitchner, that ugly traitorous
son of a bitch. I run faster. Legs numb with exhaustion. Lungs aching. All I
am, I put into this moment. My life in the mines, the hours suffering with
Harmony, the horrors at the Institute. All the love I’ve earned and lost and
still wish to live for, I let burn in me.
      Half the entourage waits on the pavement, left behind to watch the ship
as its lights glow and its engines prime. The decoys mimic its motions. A
Bellona Gold turns as I near. His eyes flash wide and I slash him at the run
as he lets out a half scream. More turn—women, men, warriors, Politicos,
Golds and Silvers I recognize from my days at Augustus’s side.
      Their realization of my presence comes in waves. The enemy is
supposed to be at the gates, not amongst them, so they flinch in seeing me.
And when they gather their wits, I’m already past their armored hands. I
dodge a Gray’s outstretched grip, snag a small munitions pouch from his
waist. I lash backward, hitting flesh.
      Shouts. Fumbling for razors. Bullets, pulseblasts, snap past my head.
The shuttle’s ramp retracts as it begins to rise.
     I scream and jump with all the might I’ve ever had. The hand of my
injured right arm grips the ramp’s edge. My eyes bug from my head with
the strain and pain in my fingers. The ship continues to rise. The roar of the
engines fills me, rattling my heart against my ribs. The ramp continues to
close. I grunt desperately and jerk myself upward, awkward at the odd
angle, but possible in the low gravity. I roll forward into the bay and onto
my knees and pant, slingBlade against the floor. The sound of the engines
slipping away as the door shuts and pressurizes. All I hear is my ragged
breath and the rumble of the deadly shuttle as it makes its escape.
     I look up.
42
Death of a Gold

      Six Praetorians in full armor watch me. Karnus is with them. And Aja.
And stocky Fitchner, his eyes widening as he sees me. The Sovereign
stands in front of her Praetorians, tall but hardly coming to their shoulders.
      Blooydamn. I didn’t think they’d all still be in the bay.
      “Darrow?” Fitchner almost moans.
      “What?” Karnus laughs, looking about to see if the others notice how
ridiculous a present just fell in their laps. “What?… Andromedus, where did
you come from? It looks like Jove himself just shit you out.”
      I stay on my knees, panting, dripping blood and rain and sweat and
mud.
      “We can leverage him as a hostage,” Fitchner says quickly as the ship
rises in the sky.
      “No,” the Sovereign answers. “Achilles would never have been
ransomed, for by being captured, he loses what makes him Achilles.” She
regards me for a cool moment. I spit phlegm on the ground. “Aja, cut off his
head.”
      Aja paces toward me. “Stupid boy. No friends. No army. No hope.”
      I chuckle darkly. “Who needs hope when you have a pulseGrenade?”
      I hold up the munitions I ripped off the Gray’s belt. They recoil.
      “What do you want, Andromedus?” the Sovereign asks slowly.
      “To prove you are not invincible. Land this ship.”
      Octavia smiles and speaks into her com. “Pilot. Roll.”
      The pilot does a barrel roll. Without gravBoots I lose my feet,
slamming into the ceiling then back to the deck. My enemies stay rooted in
place. Aja kicks the pulseGrenade out the open hatch. It explodes far
beneath.
      I look out into the night, where my plan just disappeared.
      “Pride.” Octavia smiles. “I suppose it makes fools of us all.”
      I take my time looking back to her, realizing how very stupid I was to
think I could control all the variables. And now I’ve slipped up.
      “You won’t escape,” I say.
      “You know I will. Why else would you risk jumping on my shuttle?”
She nods to one of the Olympic Knights and a strange, high-pitched warble
ripples through the air twice before subsiding. A ghostCloak. Impossibly
expensive for a whole ship. My friends won’t be coming to rescue me.
      Octavia turns to Fitchner. “Rage Knight, have you a nanoCam?” He
nods and produces a ring. “Record Aja killing the Reaper.”
      Fitchner blanches.
      “Let me kill him,” Karnus begs. “My Sovereign, let me kill him for my
family. It’s my right.”
      “Your right?” she asks, surprised. “Your family has lost me Mars. You
have no rights.”
      “He’d be a better prisoner.” Fitchner steps toward the Sovereign. “Let
me talk to him. He’s my student. You would have had him serve you once
before, Octavia. Let him recant and do so again. It will show the greatness
of your power—that you can forgive even a little pisseater like this.”
      The Sovereign turns slowly to look at Fitchner, examining him. And
he realizes he’s made a mistake. “Aja, hold.” She smiles. “I want Fitchner
to kill him.”
      The ugly man just gapes. It’s one of the first times I’ve seen him
speechless.
      “Kill your student,” the Sovereign says. “Or are you not loyal?”
      “Of course I am loyal. I’ve already proven it.”
      “Then prove it again. Bring me his head.”
      “There has to be another way.”
      “He set your son against you,” Octavia says. “And you know I do not
keep things near to me that I cannot trust. So kill him.”
      “Yes, my liege.” Fitchner’s face pinches in concentration. There’s a
strange swirling of sadness in his bronze eyes. Is it so horrible seeing his
prize student die? Or is it that I am Sevro’s friend? Or is it worry for Sevro?
      “Sevro lives,” I tell him. “He survived the Rain.”
      He nods his thanks and touches his razor. Then he stumbles sideways,
shoved aside by Karnus. The huge Bellona charges me. Mouth curved in
hate, huge shoulders shelled in armor that shows the greatness of his family.
He bellows my name.
      He feints high, curves the razor diagonally at me, quick as a snake. I
side-flip forward, inside most of the swing, and put my razor through his
stomach. I let go the blade and circle around behind him as he collapses to
his kneels. “Rise so high, in mud you lie,” I whisper as I pull my blade out
of his back by its sharp end and cut off his head.
      A Praetorian runs at me. I throw my razor at him. It takes him in the
chest and he falls to the ground. I take my blade from his chest and stumble
back from the watching Praetorians.
      “Idiots,” the Sovereign mutters.
      “Should I keep recording this?” Fitchner scratches his head.
      The ship shudders again and banks hard before straightening out. My
vision wavers and I stumble to my knee. Hand on the deck. Steady myself. I
feel the new warmth spilling down my back and stomach. I’ll not kneel. Not
to her. Not to a tyrant. I stand unsteadily. Karnus missed most of me. But
not all. Blood sluices from between my neck and left shoulder where his
razor found purchase. It cut through my collar bone.
      “What a thing.” Octavia au Lune’s cold eyes survey the wound on my
neck. “Imagine this boy shaped in my house, Aja.” She shakes her head and
stares at me with a complete lack of understanding. She notes my other
wounds. My blood. My exhaustion. My youth. Yet I did all this. Two bodies
at my feet. A city stormed behind me. More taken all over Mars. My fleet
shattering the Bellona’s. The Society ready to fracture. She doesn’t
understand and she never will. But Fitchner seems to. Eyes glassy. Hands
clenched.
      “You could not shape me,” I mumble. Only Reds could. Only family,
only love, gave me this strength. But the strength fades now. It’s then that
Aja rushes forward. We exchange three moves before she knocks my blade
aside and punches me so hard in the chest with her fist that I think I’m dead.
She slams me against the ceiling like a rag doll. And when she is done, she
rejoins the Sovereign and I moan and sink into the pain.
      “Bring me his head, Fitchner,” the Sovereign commands.
      Fitchner looks at me helplessly and puts a hand out, nearly touching
her. “We should film his execution for the HC. Propaganda. Full hanging. A
state death.”
      “Fitchner …” The Sovereign’s eyebrows go up till Fitchner retracts his
hand. “Enough.” Her jaw muscles work as she thinks. “I want him gone. No
more variables. Now. Save the head for a pike. We’ll film that.”
      Fitchner’s beady eyes swell with sadness. Born the lowest of the
Golds, he rose to the top on merit alone. What a man. To think I ever
thought him weak.
     Here, at the end of things, I know we will win Mars. Augustus will be
freed. The war will continue. Gold will weaken. And Red will rebel.
Maybe, just maybe, they will rise and find freedom. I’ve done what Ares
asked. I created chaos. The rest will go to other men, women. Eo would be
pleased.
     I smile softly and feel the weakness in my legs. I am tired. I’m on my
knees. When did I get there again? I care not. How very nice it will be to
rest in the Vale while others carry out Eo’s dream. I just wish I’d seen
Mustang before the end. Told her what I am, so at last she’d understand.
     “Your boy burned bright. And fast,” Aja says to Fitchner from the
shadows of my vision. “Keep the head. But you can cast the body to the soil
in the Martian way.”
     Aja reopens the drop ramp. Metal groans. I feel the wind of the Vale
on my face. Feel the chill of mist. The scent of rain. I’m going to sleep.
Soon I’ll wake beside Eo. I’ll wake in our warm bed, my hand tangled in
her hair. I’ll wake to love and know that in the world before, I did my best.
     I’ll miss you though, Mustang. More than I’ve admitted until now.
     Fog and shadows are my vision. For a moment, the smell of rust makes
me think I’m in the mine. Am I asleep? I hear metal boots. A man walking
through the fog. I can’t see his face. But something stirs in me. Father? No,
not Father. I squint.
     “Uncle Narol.”
     “No. It’s Fitchner, boyo.”
     His voice jerks me violently back into the hold of the ship. Like a
fishing hook tearing silk a direction it doesn’t wish to go.
     “Oh. I’m glad it’s you,” I say quietly, finding enough strength to lift
my heavy head a bit more to look him in his eyes. Tears fill them. He
coughs out a laugh. The wind whistles behind me. Not the Vale. Just Mars.
Not mist. Just the clouds. The ramp’s down so they can push my body out. I
told Arcos I was never meant to have gray hair.
     My head dips. I spit out some blood in my mouth. I’m nauseous and
fading. “Tell Mustang … Eo … I love them.” I yawn so deeply.
     “You bloodydamn fool,” he says in a low whisper, shaking his head. “I
had it under control.”
     “I didn’t …” I blink through the fog. “What?”
     “It is me,” he says. “It’s always been me, boyo.”
     The fog disappears. I look up at him. I look up at Ares as he dons his
Rage Knight helmet and shoots his pulseFist back at the Praetorians,
sending them scattering. He tosses back a sonic grenade.
     “Fitchner!” the Sovereign roars. “TRAITOR!”
     An explosion. Something hits my chest and I’m falling. Tumbling.
Flying? Sense cold. Ragged wind biting me. Stomach in my throat.
Spinning. Then a rigid arm under mine. Rising. Wind whips past my ears.
But there’s another sound before the darkness swallows me. Fitchner—Ares
—terrorist lord of the underworld, howls like a wolf as he carries me to safe
harbor.
43
The Sea

      I wake to the smells of the sea. Brine, seaweed, carried on a brisk
autumn wind. Gulls cry. One banks and perches on the whitestone sill of the
open window. It cocks its head at me and flies away into the morning
sunshine. Clouds move distantly across the horizon, promising rain even as
early morning dew drips down the open skylight.
      She stirs at my side. Her slender body atop the sheets, coiled around
my own damaged form. She’s clothed. I’m shirtless. Fresh skingrafts mark
my body. Glossy things, pink and tender to the touch. Mustang stirs once
more, her movement bringing me into my own body. Making me feel the
aches and the pains and the comfort of her closeness. I let my eyelids drift
shut and I sigh deeply, allowing myself to sink into the soft pleasures of
being human. Her breath against my neck. The drumbeat of another heart
against my rib cage. Her golden hair tickles my nose as cool wind blows
strands into my face. The morning air is young, vital.
      I breathe it deep, slipping back into sleep.
      Memories of metal shatter the peace.
      Screams echo in the black. Friends die.
      My eyes burst open for the light, desperate to remind me where I am.
Telling me I’m safe. I’m warm. There’s no metal here. Only cotton sheets.
A bed. A warm girl. Yet the memories are so close. How did I survive?
      I fell from the sky with Fitchner.
      Ares—a truth that’s always been, but seems so new I cannot even grasp
it. I woke to a Yellow’s tools inside my chest, restarting my heart. Then I
woke again to a Carver’s scalpel against my skin. Agony and nausea my
bedmates. Tides of vision ebbing in, flowing out. Visitors coming and
going. I prefer waking to this.
      I’m afraid to close my eyes again. Afraid of what I’ll see, what I’ll
wake to find. As a Red child, I shared my small cot with Kieran. Every
morning, I’d wake before him and lie there quietly, letting my parents’
hushed voices seep under the flimsy door as they started their day. I’d hear
Father’s shuffling feet. The throat-clearing sound he’d make every morning
as he washed sleep from his face. Mother would make him coffee, grinding
the cubes she’d trade to the Grays for pitviper eggs or spools of silk stolen
from the Webbery.
      I wish it was the sound that woke me at the same time every morning.
The grinding, the smell. I wish I could say it was how my body knew to
return from sleep. But it wasn’t the smell of coffee or Mother’s tea. It
wasn’t the morning sigh of water running through pipes or the arthritic
creak of rope ladders as the men and women from Lykos Township’s
nightshift made their way home from the mines and Webbery. It wasn’t the
weary murmur of those of the dayshift making their way to work from
home.
      What woke me was the dread of a closing door.
      Each morning it would end the same. First, the clay dishes would clink
into the metal sink. Then Father’s plastic chair would scrape the stone floor.
They would stand together at the door, whispering. A silence. I always
imagined it was the moment they shared a long kiss. Then at last, it’d be the
goodbye. The front door opened, creaking on rusted hinges. And finally,
despite all my prayers, it’d close.
      I lean close to Mustang and kiss her forehead. Harder than I meant to.
She wakes delicately, like a cat stretching itself out of a summer nap. Her
eyes don’t open, but she nuzzles into my side.
      “You’re awake,” she murmurs. Her lashes flutter and she bolts upright,
away from me. “Sorry. Must have fallen asleep.” She looks to the chair
she’d been sitting in. “On the bed.”
      “It’s fine. Stay. Please.” I’d forgotten we’re supposed to be cold to one
another. “How long has it been?”
      “Since the assault? A week.” She brushes loose strands of hair from
her eyes. “I’m glad you’ve come back to us.”
      “Who did we lose?” I ask carefully.
      “Lose?” Her hands fidget awkwardly as she lists the casualties. A
moment of silence stretches long. The numbers crushing me in my bed. I
remember to breathe.
      “Your father?” I ask.
      “You don’t know?” She smiles awkwardly and sighs a bit too casually,
trying to loosen her own tension. She scoots closer on the bed, still taking
care not to touch me. “It’s going to be tedious catching you up.”
      “I’m sure you’ll manage.”
      “Father is alive. When the shields fell, several Golds already inside the
Citadel led a lurcher squad to rescue him. Turns out my brother has a long
reach. So when the Olympic Knights came to take him with Octavia, they
left empty-handed.
      “The HC channels are calling Roque ‘Nelson reincarnate.’ He captured
more than eighty percent of the Bellona fleet.” Her tone darkens. “Which
means, as leader of the engagement, he has claim to at least thirty percent of
the ships, the rest going to the House Augustus.”
      “Meaning he has more than I do, technically.”
      “The pundits are wondering how long his loyalty will last now that …”
      “The Jackal is playing his games,” I interrupt with a laugh.
      “He never stops. “
      “I don’t think Roque will take up arms against me,” I say. “Do you?”
      She shrugs. “Power creates opportunities. I told you to mend things
with him.”
      “Roque is our ally. He always will be. You know him.”
      “He’s been here as much as Sevro.” She smiles slowly. “Fell asleep
here last night. I shooed him away earlier. But I wouldn’t be doing my job if
I pretended he wasn’t a potential threat to us.”
      Us, I note.
      “Your job?” I ask. “Which is …?”
      “I’ve appointed myself your chief Politico.”
      “Have you now?”
      “I have. The game of court can be a nasty, duplicitous business. You’re
much too earnest for it. Like a lamb thinking it an honor to be invited to a
banquet thrown in its honor by wolves.”
      “And what if it’s you I need to be protected from?”
      “Well.” She arches her left eyebrow. “Then I suppose you’ve already
lost.”
      I laugh and ask about Sevro.
      She pretends to look around. “He’s not asleep at the foot of the bed? I
think he’s off with his father. I only returned from visiting Kavax in orbit
last night, but Theodora says Sevro departed shortly after dinner with
Fitchner. Thought he hated the man.”
      “He does.”
      “What’s changed?”
      I shrug and wonder how long Sevro has known about his father’s true
identity. Seems impossible he was as blind as I. Was someone lying to me
for a change?
      “And Lorn?” I ask.
      “He’s with that harpy, Victra.”
      “What’s wrong with Victra?”
      “Aside from the fact that she flirts with everything that moves?
Nothing.”
      “Wait. She flirts with you? Tell me more about that.”
      “Shut it.” Mustang swats at me. But her smile falls just as quick and
she pulls her hand back. “Lorn’s taken Victra under his wing. Seems he’s
comfortable allying his family with the Julii. Victra’s mother has agreed to
the pact. Three of the most powerful houses on Mars united under my
family. A triumvirate against the Sovereign. The Governors of the Gas
Giants are on their way to Agea for a summit. So too are the Reformers.
You were right. We take Mars, we have a chance against Octavia. This isn’t
just a battle any longer. It’s a civil war. And not a pointless one, it seems.
Father is making talk of giving the Reformers a chance at the table. That …
this means something.”
      I remember my conversation with the man. “And you believe him?”
      “I do, Darrow.” She smiles hopefully. “For the first time in a long time,
I really do.”
      I am not so sure. “What about …”
      “Cassius?” she guesses quietly. “His father was killed by the
Telemanuses, and he fought Ragnar on the wall. All his brothers and sisters
are reported dead. But he and his mother are missing.”
      I note her quiet. “Are you worried he’s dead?”
      “He is our enemy,” she says flatly. “His welfare isn’t my concern.” She
examines my eyes closely. “Are you worried?”
      “I don’t know.” I consider.
      “Goryhell. You’re so tender sometimes. Do you regret cutting off his
arm, too?”
      “I regret killing Julian.”
      “We’re all stained by the past.” Mustang considers. “You forget I had
to kill someone in the Passage too. Every Peerless Scarred you’ve ever met
—Lorn, Sevro, Pebble, Tactus, Octavia, Daxo, we all started there. Often I
think there’s too much to regret.”
      Is she talking about us? Am I a regret?
      “I want to hate Cassius,” I say slowly. “I really do. Even thinking of
him makes me want to crush something. Break a window. Or, preferably,
his ugly smug face.”
      “Ugly?” she asks skeptically.
      “So pretty he’s ugly.”
      Mustang laughs at that. “But it’s hard to keep the hate going, isn’t it?”
she asks.
      I nod. Hate is what made Cassius’s family throw themselves against
Augustus’s. Look what that brought them. “I pity him. Wherever he is.”
      “Earlier I told you not to trust my brother,” Mustang says, redirecting
the conversation. “I meant it. I know you continued your alliance with him.
His companies are making you seem like a god. But it has to end. You owe
him nothing. Be cordial. Be polite. Don’t disrespect him in public. But no
more meetings. No more promises. Cut him off. You don’t need him
anymore. You have me.”
      This girl. Would that I could introduce her to Mother, to Kieran and
Leanna. They’d like her fire. My throat tightens slowly. Eo would like her
too.
      “I don’t have you,” I say.
      “Darrow …”
      Something strange twists inside me. Like a tight spring of emotion
finally allowed to uncoil. “When I was on the bottom of the river … I knew
I wouldn’t see you again.”
      She hesitates, wanting to reach for me, but resisting because of all
we’ve said before. “You know you don’t have my leave to die,” she jokes
instead. “Anyway, Sevro and the Howlers would never forgive you if you
tried. None of them would. You’ve so many friends, Darrow. So many
who’d run through fire for you.”
      So many who have been burned. Shuddering, I take a long breath and
close my eyes, trying not to let the guilt swallow me. The tears come
quietly, trickling out the corners of my eyes.
      “Darrow. Don’t cry,” Mustang whispers, reaching for me now. She
scoots closer, holding me. “It’s all right. It’s all over. We’re safe.”
      The sobs come, racking my chest.
      She’s wrong. It’s not over. All I see behind my eyelids is a world of
war. There is no other future for me, for us. Yet how many times have I
already been pieced back together? How much longer can all these stitches
hold? In the end, will there even be pieces left of me? I can’t stop crying.
Can’t even catch my breath. Heart thundering. Hands shaking. It all comes
out of me. Mustang, barely half my weight, holds me with her gentle arms
till I’m exhausted and can do nothing but sink back into the bed. In time,
my heart slows, finding rhythm to match hers.
       We sit that way for what must be an hour. Eventually, she kisses my
shoulder, my neck, lips pausing along the jugular as it pulses. I move my
hands to move her away, but she pushes them to the side and cups my face
with a hand.
       “Let me in.”
       I let my hands fall to the bed. Her mouth crafts a warm path to mine.
There we share the taste of my tears as her top lips slides between my own
and her tongue warms the inside of my mouth. Her hand slides up my neck,
nails grazing the skin, till she finds purchase in my hair, tugging slightly at
the tangle. Shivers lance my body.
       Gone is any semblance of resistance. All the guilt that kept me from
betraying Eo with Mustang is swept away in the chaos inside me. All the
guilt I have for knowing she is a Gold and I am a Red vanishes. I’m a man,
and she’s the woman I want.
       My hands find Mustang, pulling her body onto mine, shadowing the
length of her legs to the swell of her waist. Long-suppressed hunger wakes
in me. Filling me with heat, aching for her. All of her. Forget my restraint.
Forget my sadness. This is all I need. I won’t run. Not this time. Not when I
know how close I came to never seeing her again.
       I peel apart her clothing with slow force. Under my hands, the fabric is
like wet paper. Her skin is smooth, hot marble warmed in the sun. Muscles
coil and tense underneath as she arches her back. Hers is a body made for
movement, mocking, coiling around mine. I trace my fingers along the
curve of her lower back. She pushes into me, pulsing with breath, hips
grinding me into the bed.
       It may have been a week to her, but for me it was minutes, seconds ago
that I kneeled against cold steel warmed by my own blood, waiting for men
to cut off my head. This a moment I thought I would never have again as I
dug Eo’s grave with my own trembling hands. A moment with a woman I
want and love. And what is the bloodydamn point of surviving in this cold
world if I run from the only warmth it has to offer?
44
The Poet

      I walk slowly down the stone hall with Mustang. Out the windows,
guards patrol the estate. They’re here to keep us as much as protect us. Rain
falls lightly. Laughter drifts out an open door with the smells of coffee and
bacon.
      “What do you mean I can’t be funny?” Roque asks, offended.
      “Just that,” Daxo says smoothly. “I’m sure you can try, but you’re too
… scholastic.”
      “Fine then, who was the first carpenter?”
      “Is this a joke?” Daxo asks.
      “It’s intended to be.”
      “Jesus of Nazareth …?” Daxo guesses. “It is a history joke, yes?”
      “Noah?” Pebble tries. Mustang and I pause outside the door, smiling to
one another.
      “Jesus of Nazareth?” Roque laughs. “You can do better than that.”
      “If I knew I’d be mocked for guessing, I wouldn’t have guessed.”
      “Pax said you were the smart one,” Thistle says. “Disappointing,
Daxo. Disappointing.”
      “Well, in comparison, he probably—” Clown begins. “Ow!”
      “Don’t talk shit about Pax,” Pebble snaps. “Big man was a sweetie.”
      “Does no one care about the answer?” Roque asks melodically. “Fine.
Fine. I understand. You all think I’m a bore.”
      “We’re dying to know,” Thistle snaps. “Do tell.”
      “Who was the world’s first carpenter?” Roque asks again.
      “You don’t have to start all over!” Pebble moans.
      “Well, it works best that way.” Roque sighs. “Eve.”
      “Eve?” Daxo asks.
      “Because …,” Roque leads. “She made Adam’s banana stand?”
      A collective moan.
      “That’s just embarrassing,” Pebble says with a sigh. “Never thought
I’d miss Tactus.”
      Then a high-pitched whining laugh springs out of Daxo. Just like Pax.
“Eve! Eve, he said. Banana stand. Ahh.” It’s like the giants have little
ridiculous elves inside them just waiting to spring out and cackle. Just takes
a lot of provocation.
      “I think he broke Daxo,” Pebble giggles.
      “Does anyone smell that?” Clown asks.
      “I smell bacon,” Daxo tries. There’s a crunch as he bites into a piece.
      “No,” Clown says. “Smells like a suicidal madman recently risen from
the dead after conquering a planet and abandoning his friends to get himself
cut to gory ribbons like a slagging fool.”
      Daxo sniffs. “That’s a particular scent.”
      “Oh, Darrow dear,” Clown calls. “Are you lurking behind the door?”
      Mustang pushes me out awkwardly.
      “You eavesdropping Pixie!” Daxo glides to his feet and pulls me into a
surprisingly gentle hug. The golden angels on his bald head glitter in the
morning light. “Glad to see you, my friend.”
      They all greet me in turn. More hugs than I’ve ever received from
Golds. Roque hugs me mechanically. A perfunctory gesture. There is still
mending to be done.
      I gorge myself on breakfast as my friends banter. We spend the day on
the property, whiling away time in conversation and games. It’s been so
long since I’ve had either that I’ve nearly forgotten how to do nothing.
Mustang has to kiss my ear and tell me to relax three times before it really
sticks. We’re in the library listening to music when she sees Roque out the
window on the lawn. She nudges me.
      “Go.”
      I find Roque watching a pair of deer eat from a feeder underneath an
old elm. He doesn’t turn to look at me as I sidle up next to him. It smells
like fresh-cut grass. The sea somewhere over the hill.
      “It makes sense this is where Mustang grew up,” I say. “It’s wild and
tranquil all at once.”
      “My home was in the city,” Roque says. “Though I snuck off to the
country with my tutors whenever Mother was away. Which was often. She
seemed to think there was nothing out here worthwhile. That the business of
cities was more important than this. But this why we fight, isn’t it?”
      “For land?” I ask.
      “For peace, in whatever way we find it.” He turns to me. “Isn’t that
why you fight?”
      “Some of us weren’t born with peace,” I say, gesturing to the deer and
the land. “I didn’t have this growing up. Anything I have now or will have
in the future I have to earn. But you’re right. It’s why I fight, so I can have
this for me and the people I care about.”
      His eyes search my face. “Fair enough.”
      “I want to apologize to you, Roque.”
      “Oh?”
      “Since the Academy, I’ve kept you at arm’s length. I’ve taken you for
granted. I shouldn’t have done that. Not when you’ve always been so kind
to me.”
      “I didn’t mind that it was always about you, Darrow. That was what
burned Tactus, but nor me. I’m not in love with you like Mustang. I don’t
worship you like Sevro or the Howlers. I was a true friend. I was someone
who saw your light and your dark and accepted both without judgment,
without agenda. And what did you do to me? You used me like a man uses a
horse. I’m better than that. Quinn was better than that.”
      “Are you better than this friendship?” I ask quietly, afraid of the
answer.
      “I think I’m better than you,” he says. I step back, wounded. He
watches the deer nibble at the grain in the feeder. “I’ve sat by the bedsides
of three friends this year. Quinn, Tactus, and you. Each time I knew I would
have gladly have switched places with any of you. Would you wish the
same?”
      “I’d give my life to bring them back,” I say, knowing it is a lie. Much
as I love these Golds, I have greater responsibilities. Until this is over, it’s
not my life to give.
      He turns from the deer to watch me, eyes warm and sad and carrying
so much more weight than they ever should. He’s different from me, from
Cassius. We called him brother, and he was one better than either of us
deserved. “Have you ever wondered why they put me in House Mars? I’m
not the typical draft. Most would probably put me in Apollo or Juno.”
      “Quinn always had that competition in her blood. But you … Yes, I’ve
wondered.”
      “Darrow.” I turn to see Sevro standing behind us in uniform. “It’s
urgent.”
     “Not now, Sevro.”
     “Reap, I’m not shitting you,” he says.
     I look back to Roque. “Go,” he says, and walks toward the deer,
pulling berries from his pocket.
     “Roque,” I call to him plaintively.
     “Friendships take minutes to make, moments to break, years to repair,”
he says, turning to glance over his shoulder. “We’ll talk again soon.”
     I watch him go, feeling a small bit of hope warm me. I turn to Sevro
and clap his shoulder. “Good to see you. Sorry about—”
     “Piss off. I’m not a whiny little bitch like the poet. It’s Ares. Your
friends, the Red, the Pink, and the Violet, have gotten themselves captured.”
     “By whom?”
     “Who do you think? The Jackal.”

Helldivers

     My ship lands in the early morning snowfall of Attica, a southern
mountain city set on seven peaks. Jagged buildings of steel and glass
christen the peaks like icy thorn crowns, now dusted with fresh powder. The
red morning sun rises over the mountain range to the east. Bridges link the
seven peaks, and the city’s lesser wards spill around the roots of the
mountains. My shuttle flies over them. Plows melt paths through the snow
with pulsing orange blades. Soon, midColor landcars will flow along the
avenues. And highColor shuttles will ferry Silvers and Golds to their offices
on the mountain peaks. Remote and renowned for its banking, Attica is a
prime seat of power. It belongs now to the Jackal.
     Under heavy guard by ripWings, I land on a platform surrounded by
evergreens. Several lurchers wait there in white tactical gear. A lone Gold
stands with them. Victra embraces me with a hug, a white fur pelt pulled
tight about her shoulders. Jade earrings clatter in the breeze as the Grays
inspect the outside of my ship.
     “Victra,” I say, holding her back to look at her. She grins devilishly and
kisses my cheek, grabbing my butt as she does. I jump in surprise. She
laughs merrily.
     “Just making sure the pieces are in order. You had us worried, darling.
Roque kept me apprised while I was with Lorn.”
     “Brokering another alliance, I hear.”
     “Who would have thought, Victra au Julii, the peacemaker.”
     The Grays notify me that they have orders to search my ship.
     “Ragnar,” I call. He steps out of the ship’s confines, near twice the size
of the largest Gray. “Let the mice search the ship. They’re looking for …”
     The Gray spares a glance at Ragnar, swallows. “Bombs, dominus.”
     Victra escorts me into the Jackal’s new home—a fortress citadel atop
the highest of Attica’s peaks. The city stretches far beneath us. Trees line
the path from the landing pad to the citadel. “Adrius took the place soon as
the last Bellona ship retreated. Came in with a thousand lurchers and
displaced the Bellona allies who owned the place. Took all they had.
Emptied their bank accounts. Full-on theft. But that’s war.” She nods to the
west. “Wonderful slopes just a few klicks out. We’ll take a few days when
this all settles down. You bring Virginia, I’ll find myself a man.” Nearly my
own height, she looks sideways at me. “You do ski, don’t you?”
       I snort out a laugh. “Never had the time.”
       We find the Jackal in his living room. Walls and floor are glass. Fire
swirls under the floor, licking up in columns near the window. Several
minimalist chairs of steel and leather sit on fur rugs. The Jackal is hunched
over a holoDisplay, speaking quickly to someone. He motions us to take a
seat. On the holo, I glimpse Harmony in a dark room, surrounded by Grays.
One is hunched over her, doing something with some device I can’t quite
see.
       We sit by the flames, but a chill goes through me that no fire can
dispel.
       The Jackal finishes, giving a dataStrip to Sun-hwa before she leaves.
He joins us, rubbing the back of his neck.
       “So many moving parts.” He winces. “Hell, organizing the food
shipments alone takes a hundred Coppers. And those odious little shits will
spend all day bickering about whether or not a ship should have granola or
muesli in its galley. Both is an option. Both! How difficult is that, really?
It’s like they enjoy the spreadsheets and busywork. Mind boggling.”
       “I keep telling him he should delegate more efficiently,” Victra says.
So they’ve been talking too. I’m behind.
       “I hate delegating,” the Jackal replies. He scratches his head. “At least
with numbers and particulars. You two can take all the gory planets you
like. Just leave me my bureaucracy, please.”
       “Kind of you,” I laugh. “Just keep me away from food requisition
orders.” I lean forward. “I hear the fleet will be ready to depart for the Core
in two weeks. By the bye, wonderful new home you have.”
       “I like it,” he sighs. “Father is furious I took it for myself, of course. I
wanted to give it as a present to one of the Governors of the Gas Giants.”
       “I think you’ve earned it,” I say. “That and more.”
       “Exactly.” The Jackal makes a tired motion with his lone hand. “I
came here as a boy to ski with Mother. I always looked up here and said it’d
be mine. Father said you can’t have everything you want.”
       “And you asked, Why not?” Victra says. She’s already heard the story.
      “Why not?” the Jackal repeats the words fondly. “So if Father wants it
back, he’ll have to make his own food purchase orders.”
      We all know it isn’t food purchase orders that occupies his time. Not
solely.
      I accept a cup of tea from a Pink. A small spread of breakfast is placed
in front of me. I’m seven hours behind this timezone, but I can’t let on how
nervous I am.
      The Jackal watches me spear a melon with my fork. Who knows what
he thinks behind those dirty gold eyes? “So, Darrow, healed and mended in
time for the great battle.”
      “Mending,” I say. “No thanks to your media. The HC shows all say
I’ve become immortal since Karnus opened me up.”
      “It’s all part of the game, my goodman. Perception, deception, media!”
He slaps his hand on his thigh, though his eyes don’t share the mirth. “Give
me the word and I can go public with your improved vitality. We’ll
schedule a press conference. Dress you in armor. My Violets are building
you a proper suit of your own. They’ve been conspiring with Greens to give
you a marvel of form and tech.”
      “You know I hate the cameras.”
      “Oh, stop whining. They’re why we have half our allies. And why the
Sovereign’s scrambling like a spider on ice. Her coalition is … stressed.”
      “We’ll do it today then,” I say. I look out the window, remembering
Roque’s words. “I wanted a moment of peace, but …” They join me in
looking at the falling snow and the distant city beneath. “I suppose we’ve
yet to earn that. Which brings me to why I called this meeting.”
      “I admit I’ve been curious,” the Jackal says.
      “He’s been dying to know,” Victra corrects.
      I nod to Ragnar, who followed Victra and me into the room. He comes
forward with two boxes from my ship. “I wanted to give you both gifts. Our
alliance has had an … interesting beginning. But I want you both to know
how committed I am not only to it, but to each of you. I hope you take this
to be a sign of my trust.”
      “Always trust a Stained bearing gifts.” Victra chuckles, looking up at
Ragnar. “Goryhell, go over there. You’re like a tree blocking out the light,
Ragnar.”
      “Ragnar, wait outside,” I say.
      The Jackal doesn’t even look at Ragnar. Physical power bores him.
      Snapping her fingers so I bring my attention back to her, Victra
unwraps her box to find a small crystal bottle I had Theodora commission
from the Carvers on the Pax before the siege of Mars.
      “Petrichor,” I say as she opens the bottle. The room fills with the smell
of stone before rain. She thanks me with a scarred hand on my forearm,
holding the bottle close to her chest.
      “No one remembers that sort of thing. Thank you, Darrow.” She sits
there for a moment before rising quickly and kissing me on the lips. I would
have preferred the cheek.
      “My turn.” The Jackal unwraps his box with his lone hand. Tearing
through the paper with a grin on his face. He opens the leather box beneath
and is quiet for a long moment. “Darrow, you shouldn’t—”
      He’s cut short as a high-pitched alarm screams out of the walls.
      A Gray lurcher bursts into the room, weapon drawn. Four others
accompany her. “Dominus, we have a breach in the lower level. We have to
escort you to a safer room.”
      “Who?” the Jackal rasps. Victra and I draw our razors. The Gray is
about to answer when the alarms are cut short and replaced by a rising
humorless laughter over the speakers. It echoes through the room even as
the lighting of the place blacks out. We hurry to the door. A small metal
spider clinks onto the window. The glass melts. My vision and hearing
vanish. Replaced by a swarming, high-pitched keening. I stumble, stunned
by the flash grenade.
      Dark shapes fly into the room. Blinking, I glimpse cacodemon masks.
Eyes glowing red out of terrible visages. The Sons have come. They shoot
the Grays and kick us to the ground. Ragnar storms in from the hall and
catches three stunFist blasts to his chest. He goes down like a felled tree.
One masked intruder bends over the Jackal. As my hearing returns, I make
out that he’s screaming for the code to the facility’s mainframe. He shoves
the muzzle of his scorcher into the Jackal’s mouth till the Jackal gives it up.
      “Some Gold,” rasps a distorted voice.
      Behind the mask, I know Sevro would love nothing more than to pull
the trigger, and for a moment I think he’s going to. But he waits for me as
he’s supposed to. And on cue, I rise sluggishly, shaking off the results of the
flash grenade, and grab one of the intruder’s weapons, taking it for myself. I
fire at them. They fire at me. Each of us missing on purpose. Then they are
gone, back out the window. The Grays lie dead on the ground. Victra bleeds
from a shallow head wound and rises to her feet. The Jackal tries to stand,
blood dripping from his nose.
     Wordlessly, we try the doors to the room. They’re locked. The Sons
have control of the mainframe now. The Jackal leans his head against the
door. Then he rears back and slams it into the metal again, again, again till
blood pours down his face. I have to pull him away before he splits his
skull. He laughs darkly for a moment before shaking himself.
     “Twice,” he sneers. “Twice they violate me.” An animalistic shudder
goes through his body. “I was breaking them. Another day. Maybe two and
they would have cracked.”
     “Who?” Victra asks.
     He doesn’t answer. I press the question. “Who, Adrius? Who the hell
was that?”
     “Terrorists. Came for captured Sons,” he says impatiently. “One was
the Pink bitch who tried to kill us on Luna, Darrow. It wasn’t Pliny after all.
It was the Sons. Another was one of Ares’s right hands. They call her
Harmony. A Violet was with them. Making them an army of carved
soldiers.”
     “You had captured Sons of Ares here? When were you going to tell us
this?” Victra snarls, standing from checking the pulse of a dead Gray.
     “I wasn’t. Not until I knew who Ares was.”
     “What else are you keeping from us?” I say. “This is a partnership.” I
kick over a table. “Why the goryhell do you have me if not to protect you
from things like this?”
     “My fault,” he says. “My fault.” He swallows the blood in his mouth
and walks toward the empty window bank, gripping my shoulder as he
passes. Wind howls in. “You did protect me. Yet again. Thank you.”
     I scowl and brood in fine actorly fashion.
     “They couldn’t have been Reds,” I say bitterly. “Couldn’t have been
Sons. Sons never would have, could have done that. Not to me. Not to
Ragnar.” I help the Stained from the floor. “They were too organized. They
had gravBoots.”
     “You underestimate them, my friend,” the Jackal says. “They can pull
triggers too. And they would have pulled them with their muzzles against
our heads if you hadn’t stopped them.”
     “How the gorydamn did they get past your security?” Victra asks.
“Were there tracking devices? Signal jammers? GravBoot signatures?”
     “I don’t know,” the Jackal says.
     Because the Sons held on to my hull wearing ghostCloaks, like little
barnacles.
     “Who else has come and gone?” I ask.
     He looks around as I hoped he might. He calls up his men on a com at
his desk. After a moment, he looks back up to us. “Sun-hwa,” he whispers.
“Her men are dead and she’s gone like the wind. She survived the last
attack too.” Then he laughs. “She betrayed me.” And when he sees the
money transferred to Sun-hwa’s accounts, he’ll find all the corroborating
evidence he needs to pin the blame on his chief of security. Only thing is,
Sun-hwa is loyal as a dog and dead as a doornail in the cargo hold of the
shuttle that now tears away from the Jackal’s winter citadel carrying
Fitchner, Sevro, and my once-captured friends.
     I come beside the Jackal as Victra tries the door again. Together we
watch the ship disappear beyond the mountains. And I say in a low,
menacing voice, “We will kill the rats, together. I promise. All of them.”
     “After the Sovereign,” he says, patting my back. “After the
Sovereign.”
46
Brotherhood

       I hug Dancer so hard his back cracks. He taps me in panic. I apologize
and separate, feeling large as a Telemanus next to him. Outside the garage-
turned-makeshift-office, the Sons of Ares warehouse rattles with industry.
They brought me in through the side door and had me wait for Dancer
amongst old engines and rusted aerlons.
       Dancer pulls back from me and looks up, rusty eyes glittering with
tears. Startling to think that I once considered him a handsome man. He’s in
his forties; old for a Red. Hair shot with gray. Face creased by age and
hardship. His right arm still hangs limp. His foot still drags. And his smile
still stretches wide enough, baring uneven, imperfect teeth.
       “My boy,” he says, gripping my shoulder with his left hand. It’s
stronger than all the rest of him put together. He smells like tobacco. Nails
are yellow. “My bloodydamn beautiful little bastard of a boy. You look so
bloody grand!” He laughs and laughs again, shaking his head. “There are no
words. I’m sorry I couldn’t reach you. Sorry I let Harmony use you like
that. There are so many things, Darrow.”
       “Stop.” I clap the back of his neck. “We’re brothers. No need for
apologies. We’re bound by blood and past. But please, please don’t let it
happen again.” He nods. “How is my family, do you know?”
       “Alive,” he says. “Still in the mines. I know. I know. But that’s the
safest place for them with this war abound. No one wants to blow up Mars’s
industry. Register?
       He waves me to a seat. “Don’t know many Golds, but that Sevro’s a
nasty little shit. When I delivered his father’s instructions to him out on the
Rim, I thought he was going to cut me from gob to pucker.” He lights a
burner, winks at me. “Never met anyone like him.”
       “He’s loyal as they come,” I say. “Like you.”
       “No! I mean he can swear better than any bloodydamn Red.”
       “Sevro swears?” I smile. “Guess you get used to it. Though he does
like saying ‘bloody’ a hell of a lot now.”
      “It’s a fine word. Rolls off the tongue. Done some research.” He puffs
up his chest. “Been with us since the first ancestors, you know. The first
Golds, the ones with normal eyes and gold uniforms, took most of the early
recruits from the poor bastards from the Irish isles after the radiation from
London turned the isles into a wasteland. The Golds took the highly skilled
migratory workforce and recruited them to be the first Pioneers. Their slang
just stuck around, jumbled up a bit. History’s fascinating, isn’t she?”
      “Harmony’s been making up her own history,” I say.
      “That’s right. I’m dead!” He shakes his head and lights another burner,
flicking the other onto the floor. I pick it up and put it in the wastebasket.
“She went her own way about a year after you left. We discovered several
Senators were going to be vacationing on the Gorgon Sea. So we showed up
to bug their villa to see if we couldn’t get any secrets. We didn’t. Just lots of
… depraved shit. And that was that, we thought. But not for Harmony. On
the last night, she walked in and killed the Senators and their guests. Then
she left us.”
      “So there was never a lurcher squad that raided your headquarters?”
      He shakes his head. “They came because of her. Killed Matteo and
about forty others. But she’d already left for Luna. Ares saved us. Came in
hard with a mixed pack of Obsidians and Grays. Laid waste to those
lurchers, then slipped away before reinforcements came. It’s lucky he killed
them all. No way they wouldn’t know he was a Gold after that. Had our
first face-to-face that day. Man’s bloodydamn scary.”
      “Not the word I’d choose.” Though maybe it’s accurate considering
how well he fooled me. “It doesn’t bother you that he’s a Gold?”
      “It doesn’t bother him that we’re Reds. Ares would die for the cause,
Darrow. Shit. He started it. You know why he did?”
      I shake my head.
      “It’s his story.” Dancer traces the pitviper bites on his neck. “A man
has the right to tell his own story. But his isn’t a happy one. Sad as yours.
Sad as mine. Strip a man of what he loves, and what is left? Just hate. Just
anger. But he was the first to know there could be something more. He
found me. He found you. Who the bloodydamn are we to question him?”
      The door opens suddenly. We both turn and Mickey limps in. He looks
half dead, thin as a reed, paler than before. Without a word, he hobbles over
to me and kisses me full on the mouth, his affection desperate and true.
Then he starts weeping like a child. Dancer and I don’t know what to do, so
I just wrap my arms around him and let him cry. He whispers “Thank you”
to me a dozen times.
      What did they do to him? Never mind. I know the things the Grays are
trained to get information. He says he told them nothing. Still, I have to
discover what the Jackal learned from this. What deductions he’s made
from finding Mickey’s lab.
      I look over Mickey’s head to see Fitchner standing there, smiling
sadly. After a long moment, Mickey pulls back. “I tried to warn you, when
you came to us on Luna,” he says apologetically. “Wanted to say to run. But
she would have killed me if I said any more. I was afraid you would believe
her over me.”
      “I would have believed you, Mickey.”
      “You would have?” He sniffles. “I knew you’d come for me. I said my
darling boy was too kind to forget about Mickey, but she spat on me. Said I
was a slaver.” He hangs his head, sniffing and so vulnerable, drained and
nearly mad from what must have been done to him in the Jackal’s torture
chambers. “She was right. I am. I am wicked. I hurt the girls and boys. I
sold them even when I loved them. Of course she was right. Why would
you come? Why would you do anything for wicked little Mickey?”
      “Because you’re my friend.” I bring his hands to my lips, kissing them
gently as he looks up at me with hopeful eyes. “Weird as you are, wicked as
you were. I know you want to be better. You want to live for more. We all
do. And there’s not a place they could take one of my friends that I would
ever abandon them.”
      It feels good to speak the truth.
      “Thank you,” he says quietly. He draws himself up after that, strong
enough to turn and walk out of the office. Fitchner closes the door.
      “Well, that was emotional.”
      I nod. This is the man I’d rather be. Not constantly on guard. Not lying
through my teeth. I suppose I didn’t even know how much affection I felt
for Mickey till now. It’s not because he helped make me. It’s that he’s
always loved me so much. Even if it was a strange sort of love, it was real.
And I do believe he wants to be a man he thinks I would respect. Just like I
want to be a man Eo and Mustang would respect. And that’s the good sort
of love.
      “We need to talk, Fitchner,” I say. We didn’t have a chance earlier.
Sevro came to me with Dancer’s plan—call a meeting, attach the Sons to
my ship, let them infiltrate the building. All I did was suggest Sun-hwa as
the scapegoat, and let them know Victra was not to be harmed.
      “I’ll leave you two to it,” Dancer says, pushing back his metal chair.
      “No, I want you to stay,” I say. “I’ve too many secrets from too many
people. I won’t have any more between the three of us.”
      “Learn to count, shithead,” Sevro says, coming around a rusted engine
block. The cheap metal door to the outside slams behind him. Smells like
autumn even in Agea’s oil-stained manufacturing district. He hops onto the
rusted chassis of an old fighter and sits with his legs dangling. “Hey, look,
it’s all pricks for once. Let’s tell sexist jokes.”
      Chuckling, I turn to Fitchner. “So you’re Ares.”
      “Man comes out of a coma and he’s a genius!” Fitchner barks. He
claps his hands, but his eyes stay deadly serious. “Most call me Bronzie.
Students call me Proctor. Some call me Rage Knight. The Sovereign calls
me traitor. My son calls me shithead …”
      “You’re a shithead,” Sevro chimes in.
      “… My wife called me Fitchner. But the Golds made me Ares.”
      Before now I would not know what that meant. He is Gold. How could
the Golds do anything to him? But now I’ve peeked behind the curtain.
“Why didn’t you tell me who you were from the start?”
      “And put my life in the hands of a teenager’s acting ability?” he
cackles. “I think not. If you were found out and they tortured you … bad
news. I had alternate plans, other irons in the fire. You just happened to be
my favorite. But we mustn’t be biased.”
      “Who was your wife?” I ask, already suspecting the answer.
      “Full or short?” he asks.
      “Full.”
      “I was liaising for a terraforming company on Triton,” he begins
gruffly. “I didn’t have a glamorous job like you. No razors. No armor. Just
construction management. Contract was leased by a Silver. I was running
one of the last Lovelock Engines on their north pole when an eruption from
one of that moon’s damn geysers caused an earthquake. Cracked the ice
crust. Spilled the whole engine into the subterranean sea. Three thousand
souls drowned.
      “They fished me out of the sea and I spent the next months recovering
in the arctic hospital. I was in the highColor wing. We had the good food.
Better showers. Newer beds. But the lowColors had the window that looked
at the northern lights. And she had the bed beside that window.”
      He looks up at Sevro. “She was the most beautiful woman I’ve ever
met. And she was pretty to look at too. She lost a leg in the accident. And
they weren’t going to give her a new one. They could. It’s simple bionics.
Not cost-effective, said the Coppers. Shittiest race ever made, I swear on
…”
      Sevro clears his throat. “Not again.”
      Fitchner throws a piece of trash at Sevro and continues. “When I left, I
took her with me. I’d saved up money enough to leave Triton. Couldn’t live
in the Core. Too expensive. So I chose Mars. We lived just outside New
Thebes for a year. We wanted a child more than anything. But our DNA
wasn’t compatible. So we went to a Carver to see if we couldn’t make some
magic. We did. Cost me almost everything I owned, but nine months later,
this little Goblin squirmed out.”
      Sevro waves from his perch as he examines the trash to see if it isn’t
edible.
      “Two years later, the Board of Quality Control busted the Carver for
some work he did on some Obsidian gladiator and he ratted us out, fastlike,
for a reduced sentence. They came to our home when I was away with
Sevro. Found my wife, took her in for questioning. Their doctors saw her
fallopian tubes had been modified so that it would be compatible to sire a
Gold child. Then they disposed of her. Says so right in the records:
‘disposed’. Gassed her with achlys-9, put her in an oven, pumped her ash
into the sea. They didn’t even give her a name, just a number. Not because
she was a thief or a murderer or had violated any man’s or woman’s rights,
but because she was a Red that dared love a Gold.
      “It wasn’t like your wife, Darrow. I didn’t watch mine die. I didn’t see
Golds come into my world and ruin it. Instead I felt the coldness of the
system swallow the only thing I lived for. A Copper pressing buttons, filling
out a spreadsheet. A Brown twisting a knob to release gas. They killed my
wife. But they won’t ever think so. She’s not a memory in their mind. She’s
a statistic. It’s as if she never existed. Some ghost I loved but no one else
ever saw. That’s what Society does—spread the blame so there is no villain,
so it’s futile to even begin to find a villain, to find justice. It’s just
machinery. Processes. And it rumbles on, inexorable till a whole generation
rises that will throw themselves on the gears.”
      “What was her name?”
      “Her name? Why does it matter?” he asks warily.
      “Because I want to remember her.”
      “Bryn,” Sevro says from above. “My mother’s name was Bryn. She
was twenty-four when they killed her.”
      “Bryn,” I repeat the word and see Fitcher rock slightly on his feet. A
shortness of breath.
      “So you’re half Red,” I say to Sevro.
      Sevro nods. “Found out couple days ago. Weird as shit, righto?”
      “Weird as shit. You’ll make a good Ruster.”
      “I like to think I’m an endangered species.”
      Dancer rolls a match through his fingers. “We all are.”
      “You knew about Titus,” I say to Fitchner.
      “But Dancer didn’t. Don’t blame him for that. I thought you’d be
brothers at the Institute. A natural affection for your own race. But he went
dark, and there was no way to reel him in. I met with him—jammer,
ghostCloak—like I met with you. But his mind broke under the strain. I
didn’t want to see you break.”
      “I did break.” I look over at Sevro, Dancer. “I just had friends to piece
me back together. Why didn’t you tell Titus and me about each other?”
      “Then his mistakes would have been yours and yours would have been
his. In a storm, you don’t tie two boats together. They’ll drag each other
down.” He clears his throat.
      “I always knew a Gold couldn’t lead this rebellion. It has to be from
the bottom up, boyo. Red is about family. More than any other Color, it is
about love amidst all the horror of our world. If Red rises, they have a
chance to bind the worlds together. MidColors won’t. Pinks, Browns, can’t.
Obsidians have failed before. And if they succeeded alone, they’d break the
worlds instead of freeing them.
      “So what’s the plan?” I ask. “I squabbed up your position next to the
Sovereign.”
      “You’re hard to manipulate, Darrow, so I’ll just cut to it. Augustus is
going to adopt you. You’re not surprised …”
      “It would make sense. He wants to tie my fate to his family. Probably
make me marry Mustang. It’ll fracture my alliance with the Jackal if I
become an heir, though.”
      “Does the Jackal care about that?” Sevro asks. “Seems like he’s
abandoned hope of ever gaining approval. Bloody bastard’s building his
own empire.”
      “I’ll have to see,” I say.
      Fitchner continues. “Dispose of the Jackal or make him part of the
plan, it doesn’t matter. Augustus will adopt you as his heir. And he will use
you as a Praetor in his armada. And if you defeat the Sovereign, he won’t
settle for being King of Mars. He’ll want to be Sovereign himself. Help him
be. And a year into his reign, Sevro will kill him and pin it on a rival,
maybe the Jackal …”
      My turn to rock on my feet.
      “You want me to inherit the empire,” I guess. “The entire Society.”
      I gawk at him. At Dancer. How can they look so serious?
      “Yes,” Fitchner says. “After he dies, all will look to the strongest. Be
the strongest. Win the game of succession and you can be Sovereign just as
you were Primus. Just as you are Praetor. It’s all games. Except this time
we’re helping you cheat. We will feed you information, guard you against
assassination attempts. With me on your side, you will have a spy network
even the Jackal and Sovereign cannot rival. We will bribe who we need to
bribe and kill who we need to kill.”
      I sit reflectively looking at my hands. “I thought the lies were nearly
over. I want to declare what I am. I want to declare war.”
      “We can’t yet. You know that.”
      I do, but I don’t want to leave these people. “I won’t be in the dark
again. We will communicate. We will plan. No more gray areas. Do you
understand? I can’t be alone like before.”
      “Say yes, Fitchner,” Sevro says. “Or I’m not going either.”
      “We’ll communicate every day, if you need. I can’t come with. There’s
a ghost war being fought that I have to manage. But in my stead, I’ll send
some of my best agents. You’ll have a cabal you can trust. Spies. Assassins.
Courtesans. Hackers. All with perfect covers. All willing to die to break the
chains. You are no longer alone.”
      Relief fills me. But there’s something I know I can’t do. “I have to go
back.”
      “Yes. They’ll be wondering where you are,” Fitchner agrees.
      “No.” I say. “I have to go home.”
      “Home?” Dancer asks. “To Lykos?”
      “Why?” Fitchner asks. “What’s left for you there?”
      “My family. It’s been four years. I need to see them.” I look each man
in the eyes, each so scarred and so wounded in his own way. “You have to
understand that. Things are about to break apart in ways we can’t predict.
We pretend we know what we’re doing, pushing these Golds to war.
Planning our own. Like we can control it, but we can’t. We’re just mortals
opening Pandora’s box. And before everything turns upside down, I need to
remember what I’m fighting for. I need to know it’s worth it.”
      “You want their blessing,” Dancer says. “Her blessing.” He knows my
heart better than Fitchner. If I’m to let Augustus adopt me, then I must go
home first.
      “You can’t tell them what you are. They won’t understand.” Fitchner
steps forward, suddenly cautious of my temper. “You know that.”
      “How much easier would this have all been if you and I had conspired
the whole way through?” I say. “Lies breed lies. We have to trust.” I look at
Sevro. “I’m taking her to Lykos.”
      “Her?” Dancer asks.
      “Mustang,” Sevro murmurs.
      “No,” Fitchner almost yells. “Absolutely not. No. It’s not worth the
risk. You’re set up now. She’s in love with you! Don’t lose that leverage
because of a guilty conscience.”
      “And what if I love her too?”
      “Shit,” Fitchner curses. “Shit. Shit. Shit. You’re serious? I thought this
was part of your gorydamn game. Shit. Boyo, you’ll ruin everything.
Gorydamn idiot. Shit.”
      “This is everything,” I say. “She loves me. I won’t use her anymore. I
won’t leverage her. If I can’t trust her, Gold can’t change, and Titus and
Harmony were right. Hell, the Society is right. You and I know that it’s not
about our Color; it’s about our hearts. Now let’s put that to the test.”
      “And if you’re wrong? If she rejects you for them?”
      I don’t have an answer.
      Sevro hops down from his perch. “Then I put a bullet in her head.”
47
Free

      The Pot is a piece of shit—a three-hundred-meter-deep nest of metal
and concrete humid with the stink of swill and cleaning agent. Once it
seemed to tower above Lykos’s Common like some lofty castle. But as my
ship descends, it’s just a dull metal blister in the southern Martian taiga, far
removed from the grand cities where men marshal for the great effort
against Octavia au Lune.
      The Grays inside aren’t fit to get paid doing anything but intimidate
Reds. To think I once considered the Grays like Ugly Dan crack troops. It
depresses me, seeing how weak and petty the demons of my youth really
were. As though I come from some hollow fantasy past.
      They did not know my ship was coming. They don’t know why I’m
here, nor must I tell them. They just scatter like horseflies as I stalk down
my ship’s ramp into the engine-blackened landing pad, Obsidian
bodyguards flowing out before me. Ragnar towering behind as I stalk
through the metal-grated halls. Any of these Grays will know how to get
where I need to go, but I am looking for a familiar face.
      “Dan,” I ask one of the Brown janitors. “Where is he?”
      I burst into one of their common rooms, where a dozen Grays play
cards and smoke cigars. A woman notices me, turning her attention from an
HC where several talking heads—a Silver, a Violet, and two Greens—
debate the political ramifications of Mars’s conquest over a montage of my
exploits. Her cigar falls out of her mouth. The man sitting at her side slaps
the cigar as it falls on his pant leg and catches the fabric.
      “Carly, you dumb meat sheath.” He flings himself back from the table.
“Goddamn. The hell is your …”
      Ugly Dan swivels to see me for the first time in four years. I can feel
the hairs on his skin rise as the spring of discipline hidden in his slothful
body snaps to attention. There’s no recognition in his eyes, no fear, just
obedience.
      This gives me no catharsis. Dan should have an impudent sneer on his
lips, a nasty hyena cast to his aspect. But he’s doesn’t. He’s tame. Obedient.
Face pocked from childhood acne. The greasy hair Loran and I teased him
for behind his back, now gone. A crater of baldness has replaced it, fringed
with shoots of withered gray. He’s as scary as a wet dog. This is the man I
let kill Eo.
      How could I not have stopped him? Was I ever so weak?
      “The bubbleGarden,” I say to Dan, voice filling the metal common
room. “Take me there.”
      I’ve already turned on a heel. Ragnar pats his thigh. “Come, dog.”
      It’s been four years since I last stood here. Stars twinkle in the gray
above as night pulls on its hood. The garden is smaller than I remember.
Less filled with color, with sounds. I suppose that’s to be expected, being
where I’ve been, seeing what I’ve seen. There’s more trash. More signs of
Grays using the place for screwing and drinking. I toe an empty beer can
with my shoe. A candy bar wrapper marks the place where Eo last lay
together.
      I remember it a bed of soft grass. But there are weeds now. Maybe
there were weeds then and I just didn’t notice them. The flowers are wilted,
paltry things. I touch one with my finger and feel a sadness pull at me as I
peer up through the bubbleRoof to see stars shooting across the sky. I snort.
Once they might have been stars. I thought them such when I was younger.
But now I know they are the warships that prepare for an assault on Luna. I
don’t know what I expected. No magic remains here.
      Should have left this place perfect in memory. I wonder if Eo is safer
there, safe from my eyes. If I saw her now, if I came back, would I be so in
love? Would she seem so perfect?
      I walk through the garden. It really is barely larger than my suites on
the Pax. I’m thicker than the trees I walk under. The grass balds near the
base of them where the roots rear through the ground.
      I find the place I came for. Haemanthus flowers live atop Eo’s grave.
Dozens. It would seem a miracle if I did not remember the flower bud I set
in the grave with her. She’s not there any longer. I know that. The Grays
would have dug her up and strung her from the Common to rot after they
hanged me.
      There’s a dark irony I’m only just realizing. I came here to ask for her
blessing but she’s not here. She’s fled this cage for the Vale.
      So I sit cross-legged, waiting for the sun to set, where once I waited
for it to rise. When it does, the day’s waning light fills the bubbleGarden
with a bloody hue. And then the sun surrenders to the horizon and night
draws its star-pierced shroud over Mars.
      I laugh at myself.
      Ragnar slips from his place at the door.
      “I’m fine,” I say without turning to him. “She’d laugh at me for
coming here.”
      “Laughter is a gift.”
      “Sometimes.”
      I stand and dust my pants, giving the place one last look.
      The garden isn’t as perfect as it was in memory. And neither was she.
She was impatient. She could be spiteful for small reasons. But she was a
girl. Not even seventeen. And she gave the most she could, did the best she
could with what she had. That’s why I will always love her, and it is why I
know whether or not she would give her blessing for what I go to do, my
heart can’t stay here in this cage she herself has fled. It must move on.
48
The Magistrate

      MineMagistrate Timony cu Podginus waits for me flanked with a
coterie of Gray mine guards, now wearing their best and brightest uniforms.
One carries a platter of cheese, dates, and Podginus’s best, and perhaps
only, caviar. Ugly Dan is gone.
      “Lord Andromedus, is it not?” Podginus croons with that supercilious
inflection uppity Coppers favor. He is fatter. His hair thinner. And he sweats
like a pig in heat as he fans open his heavily ringed fingers to favor me with
a queer bow popular in the HC political dramas. “I was examining the ore
compression facilities”—probably a whorehouse in nearby Yorkton, at the
edge of the taiga—“when news of your visit came to me. I hurried back as
best I could, but still I beg your forgiveness. I wonder, though, may I be so
bold as to ask the purpose of your visit?” So he can sell the information to
men like Pliny. Coppers rarely mean all that they say. “An inspection is not
due for …”
      “In polite society, it is considered rude not to introduce yourself,
Copper.” I talk like a Peerless, not the Pixies he so eagerly emulates.
      “My apologies!” he stammers in alarm, sweeping into a bow so deep
I’d fear he might touch his nose to the floor were it not for the cushion of
his substantial gut. “I am MineMagistrate Timony cu Podginus, your
humble servant. And may I say, if it is not too bold”—he’s still bowing
—“your aspect is grander than I had indeed expected! Not to say that I did
not expect you to be broad and tall—the ArchGovernor has only the best of
the best in his employ, naturally—but the HC does you the barest justice.”
      “You may stop bowing.”
      He straightens self-consciously and peers behind me into the garden,
fiendishly seeking the reason someone like me came unannounced to his
mine.
      “As I know you’ve no doubt heard from others, the MineMagistrates
were overjoyed to hear the planet had been liberated from Bellona control.
War, those men may know, but mining? Pfah, amateurs.”
      “They don’t know war either, apparently.”
      Swallowing, he glances again to my razor and then to the garden.
      “A beautiful space, is it not?” he asks. “It reminds me of my time on
the Pyrrus River. The tulip blossoms there—oh, the color! Nothing like it,
as I’m sure you know. And the trees, aren’t they so very like the birches that
stretch along the steppes of the Olympus Mons? I stayed there at the
Chateau le Breu.” He makes a strange expansive motion with his hands. “I
know, I know, but sometimes one must treat oneself. In fact it is where I
discovered the most unique sottocenere cheese.” He smiles proudly. “They
call me Marco Polo, my friends, because I relish travel. It’s the culture I
seek. Refined company, as you could no doubt guess, is the damnedest
thing to find around here.…”
      I don’t know how long he would continue trying to impress me if I
didn’t look at his men’s best uniforms, then at his best rings, and frown.
      “Is something the matter?” he asks.
      “You’re right,” I say.
      His beady eyes scurry back and forth between his best Grays,
searching for signs of the inequity I noticed. It disgusts me how desperate
he is to please me. This man stole from my family. He had me whipped.
Watched Eo be killed. Hanged my father. He’s not wicked. He’s just
pathetic in his greed.
      “I am right about what?” he asks, blinking at me.
      “That it is impossible to find refined company in places like this.” My
eyes fall so heavily on him I fear he might burst out crying. Seeing him,
seeing Dan, does nothing but fill me with a distant strangeness. I wanted
them to be terrible, hideous monsters. But they aren’t. They are petty men
who ruin lives and don’t even notice. How many others are there like them?
      In a panic, Podginus waves to the cheese plate.
      “Sottocenere, my liege. It’s an Italian import with notes of licorice,
winks of nutmeg, a dash of coriander and, a sprinkling of cloves, and a
playful but mysterious bit of cinnamon and fennel coated onto the rind. I’m
sure you’ll find it to your—”
      “I did not come here for cheese.”
      “No. No. Of course not.” He looks around nervously. “If I may beg to
ask, what did you come here for, my liege?”
      I begin walking. Podginus hurries to keep up. “Ragnar.” I nod to the
titan, who pulls a small datapad from his pocket. Took Pebble less than an
hour to teach him to use it.
      “Your output of helium-3 has decreased by fourteen percent over the
last quarter. Your projections show an expected shortfall of 13,500 kilos for
the current fiscal quarter. Praetor Andromedus wishes you to explain.”
      Podginus doesn’t know what to do. He looks back and forth between
me, the Obsidian, and the datapad. He stammers a response. “I—I—we
have had issues with the populace. Grafitti, illegal pamphlets.” He
addresses me. “You know we were the nucleus of the Persephone
movement …” Ragnar taps him heavily on the shoulder.
      “Praetor Andromedus is busy.”
      “I—I—” Podginus wheels about, in a nightmare he doesn’t understand
and cannot escape. “I forgot what I was—”
      “You were making excuses.”
      “Making excuses. Making excuses? How dare you!” He squares his
shoulders. “There’s a current of rebellion running through Mars. Not a mine
has been untouched by dissent. My mine is hardly the exception. There
have been killings. Sabotage. And not just from the Sons of Ares. From the
miners themselves!”
      Podginus turns to me again, desperately sensing his demise is fast
coming, feet struggling to keep up with our long strides.
      “My liege, I’ve gone above and beyond in following the proper
method of quelling dissent as laid out in section three, subsection A of the
Department of Energy’s Guide to Mine Management. I have docked their
rations, cracked down on enforcement of legal violations, and discredited
leading thought-makers by luring them into liaisons of homosexuality. I
have even introduced the recommended scenarios from On Defusing
Rebellion. Over the past six years I’ve introduced Plague and Cure,
Rebellion and Suppression, Natural Disaster, Pitviper Migration, and even
considered the Extraplanetary Government Upheaval package!” Panting, he
waves imploringly for me to stop. “No man would have done better than I.”
      “Your position is not in jeopardy,” I say.
      He shudders with relief. Suddenly his head snaps back. “You wouldn’t
…” He leans forward. “You’re considering Quarantine! Aren’t you?”
      “Why shouldn’t I quarantine this mine?” I continue on down the
corridor till we reach the landing pad where my ship waits. There, I stop.
“As you said, its populace has failed to respond favorably to strategies
endorsed by the Department of Energy and the Board of Quality Control.
Why not pump the air full of achlys-9 gas and replace the unruly Reds with
clans from compliant mines nearer the equator?”
      “No!” He actually grabs me. Ragnar doesn’t even bother threatening
the fat man.
      “Choose your words carefully,” I say.
      “My liege, don’t do it.” Tears sparkle in his greedy, panicked eyes.
“My mine’s profits may have decreased, but it is still viable, still functional.
A model of how to weather a storm.”
      “You are its savior,” I say, mocking him.
      “The Reds there are good miners. The best in all the world. That is
why they’re wild. But they’ve calmed now. I’ve increased their rations of
alcohol and increased pheromone circulation in the air units. They’re
breeding like rabbits. I’ve also had my Gamma plants tamper with their
machinery and maps. They think the mines are drying up. They’ll walk on
pins and needles, fearing they won’t make quota. Then we’ll fix the
machines, and they’ll be filled with fresh purpose. I can even tell them the
terraforming is complete and migration will begin in ten years, and that
Earth has begun sending immigrants. There are still so many options before
we must accede to Quarantine.”
      I watch the man as he sputters to an end, slumping down, lifeless as a
wet shirt on a hanger. Is this all for his own vanity or does he really care for
Reds? This was a test to see. Now I can’t tell. He might actually care in
some strange way. Another monster from my past made human by Society’s
lash.
      “Your mine is safe, for now. Maintain your workforce. Increase
rations, beginning tonight. I want happy workers and flush coffers. In my
ship you will find provisions. Food and libations. Throw the Reds a feast.”
      “My liege … a feast? Why?”
      “Because I said so.”
      I sit alone in the viewing room, watching the celebration unfold
through the glass beneath my feet. Thousands of Reds drink and eat as the
young dance around the gallows to “The Ballad of Old Man Hickory.” The
tables are filled with foods these Reds have never tasted, drinks they’ve
never downed. And though they laugh, though they dance, I cannot find any
joy myself. They live in horror, but it’s one they know. It’s one they can
find refuge from. Will there be any refuge left when the Sons of Ares reveal
the great lie? It will shatter their way of life. They will be lost in the
greatness of the worlds. And they’ll be polluted by them. Like I am.
      I recognize nearly all of them. Boys I played with, now grown. Girls I
once kissed, now with children. Nieces. Nephews. Even my brother, Kieran.
I wipe the tears from my eyes, lest someone see.
      A boy sweeps a girl into a dance after kissing her cheek. I’ll never be
like that boy again. My innocence is lost. And Reds will never accept me as
one of their own, no matter what future I bring them. I’m not a conquering
hero. I’m a necessary evil. I have no place here, but I cannot leave. There
are things that must be said. Secrets that must be revealed.
      “Still trying to create a cult?” she asks from the door. I turn to see
Mustang leaning against the metal frame, hair in a ponytail, high-collared
Politico uniform open informally at the neck.
      “I suppose I should commission statues next, yes?” I ask.
      “Ragnar is scaring the backcountry Grays.”
      “Good.”
      “You’re so mean to Grays,” she laughs. “Something you don’t like
about them?” She runs a hand through my hair as she comes to sit on the
arm of my chair.
      “They’re too obedient.”
      “Ah, so that’s why you like me.” She digs her fingernails lightly into
my scalp, teasing. “Statues are a bad idea. Too easy to deface. Vandals
could give you a mustache or breasts at their leisure. Risky proposition,
breasts.”
      “Could be worse.”
      “Well, there nothing worse than a mustache. Daxo is trying to grow
one. I think it’s meant to be ironic? I’m not sure.” Mustang laughs lightly as
she settles in on the metal chair next to me. “His sisters will sort that out.”
      She looks around at the mine and the Can. “Place is disgusting. I wrote
a piece of legislation that the Reformers plan to put through after all this.
It’ll gut the Department of Energy, restructure the Board of Quality
Control”—she looks around the Pot—“change the way this meat shop is
run. You see the supply stores in this place? Food enough for seven years,
yet they keep maxing out their acquisition orders. I took a look at their files.
The MineMagistrate’s skimming off the top. Likely reselling the supplies
on the black market. Lying Copper thought we wouldn’t notice. Probably
because some Gold or Silver told him they’d grease the right palms to make
sure no one ever noticed. All while he has a malnourished population.
Corruption everywhere.”
     She wrinkles her nose and flicks a piece of flaking paint from her
chair.
     “Why are we here?” she asks. “Did something happen with my
brother?”
     “This is the mine where the girl sang the Forbidden Song,” I say after a
moment. Her eyes open wider as she scans the crowd beneath.
     “These poor people.”
     She watches me, waiting expectantly for what I have to say. But there
are no words left. Only something to show. I take her hand and stand.
“Come with me.”
49
Why We Sing

      I’ve never felt fear like this.
      Lykos is dark at night. Lights all turned down so the Reds don’t go
mad from eternal day. Somewhere, the nightshifts weave silks, mine soil.
But here in this wide tunnel, there is no motion, no sound except the
murmur of HCs showing old terraforming holos and the hum of distant
machines. It is cool here, yet I sweat.
      Mustang is silent beside me. She has not spoken since we descended in
our gravBoots to the Common’s floor, ghostCloaks making us nearly
invisible to the lingering drunks slumped over tables and sleeping soundly
on the gallows steps. I hear the tension in her silence and wonder what she
thinks.
      My heart runs wild in my chest, so loud Mustang has to hear it as we
enter Lambda Township, where I grew from boy to man. The place is
smaller. The ceiling lower. Rope bridges and pulley systems like children’s
toys. The HC that once glowed with Octavia au Lune’s face is an ancient
relic, pixels missing. Mustang peers around, cloak deactivated. Her eyes
dance from bridge to bridge to home like she’s seeing something wonderful.
It didn’t occur to me a Gold would ever find interest in a simple place like
this.
      I climb the stone steps to the bridge that leads to my old home just like
I did as a boy. Only, my limbs are too large now. I forgot I had gravBoots.
Mustang doesn’t use hers either. She follows behind and dusts off her hands
as she makes the landing where the thin metal door to my old family home
has been cut into the wall.
      “Darrow,” she says so quietly, “how do you know where you’re
going?”
      My hands tremble.
      “You told me to let you in.” I look down at her.
      “I did, but …”
      “How far do you want to go?”
      I know she feels what’s coming. I wonder how long she’s felt it. The
strangeness of me. The odd mannerisms. The distant soul.
      She looks at her hands, stained red from the dust of the stone stairs.
“All the way.”
      I hand her a holoCube. “If you mean that, press play, and come in
when you’ve finished watching. If you leave, I understand.”
      “Darrow …”
      I kiss her one last time, hard. She clutches at my hair, sensing that
when we part, something will be different. I find myself pulling back. My
hand cups her jaw. Her eyes, closed, begin to flutter open as I step away and
turn to the door.
      I push it open.
      I have to duck to enter. The home is cramped. Quiet. The first floor is
the same as I remember. The small metal table has not changed. Nor have
the plastic chairs, the small sink, the drying clay dishes, or Mother’s prized
teakettle that heats on the stove. A new rug covers the floor. It’s the work of
a novice. Different boots sit where Father used to place his at the base of the
stairs, where I used to set mine. Wait. Those are mine. But tattered and
worn more than they’d been in my day. Were my feet really so small?
      Silence guards the house. All sleep except her.
      The teakettle hisses as the water reaches a boil. Soon it begins its
breathy murmur. Feet scrape over the stone stairs. I almost run out of the
room. But terror roots me to the spot as she comes closer. Closer till she’s in
the room with me, pausing at that last stair, foot suspended, forgotten. Her
eyes find mine. They never leave. Never look at the rest of my Golden
form. I panic as she says nothing. A breath. Three. Ten. She doesn’t know
me. I’m a killer in her house. I shouldn’t have come here. She doesn’t
recognize me. I’m a lost Gold poking his head in out of curiosity. I can
leave. Run away now. My mother never has to know what her son has
become.
      Then she finishes her step and comes toward me. Gliding. It’s been
four years. She looks twenty older. Lips thin, skin loose and webbed with
lines, hair worked through with sooty gray, hands tough as oak and gnarled
as ginger roots. When her right hand reaches for my face, I have to kneel.
Her eyes still have not left mine. Now they let out tears. The teakettle
screams on the stove. She brings her other hand to my face, but it is unable
to open and touch like the other. It remains twisted and clenched, like my
heart.
     “It’s you,” she says softly, as though I will disappear like a night
vision if she says the word too loudly. “It’s you.” Her voice is different,
slurred.
     “You know me?” I manage desperately.
     “How could I not?” Her smile is twisted, left eyelid sluggish. Life has
been less kind to her than to me. She’s had a stroke. It breaks me to see her
body fail her. To know I wasn’t here for her. To know her heart was broken.
“I would know you … anywhere.” She kisses my forehead. “My boy.
You’re my Darrow.”
     The tears leave warm paths down my cheeks. I wipe them away.
     “Mother.”
     Still on my knees, I throw my arms around her and let the silent tears
come. We say nothing for the longest time. Her scent is of grease, rust, and
the musty tang of haemanthus. Her lips kiss my hair as they used to. Her
hands scratch my back as though she remembers it just as broad as it is
now, just as strong.
     “I have to take the kettle off,” she says. “Before someone wakes and
see you like …”
     “Of course.”
     “You have to let go of me.”
     “Sorry.” I do, laughing at myself.
     “How …?” she asks me, standing there looking at the Sigils on my
hands, shaking her head. “How could this be? You … your accent.
Everything.”
     “I was carved. Uncle Narol saved me. I can explain.”
     She shakes her head, trembling so slightly she must think I can’t see it.
The kettle shrieks louder. “Take a seat.” She turns her back to me and takes
the kettle off the stove. She sets out another mug. One from the high shelf. I
remember it was my father’s. Dust covers the molded clay. She pauses,
saying nothing as she cradles it close, slipping into a moment not meant for
me, where she remembers those morning when they would ready for the
day together. With a long breath, she drops the loose-leaf tea into the mug
and pours hot water after. “Would you like anything else? We have those
biscuits you liked.”
     “No, thank you.”
     “And I took my portion from the feast tonight. It’s delicate Gold food.
Did you do that?”
     “I’m not a Gold.”
     “There are beans too. Fresh from Leora’s garden. You remember her?”
     I spare a look at my datapad. Mustang is gone, heading back to the
ship after she watched the holoCube. I feared this. I read a message from
Sevro. “Stop her?” he asks. Two choices. Let Sevro and Ragnar catch her,
and contain her till I can speak with her. Or trust her to make her own
decisions. But if I trust her, she could leave, tell her father what I am, and it
could all end. Yet she may just need time. I’ve given her so much to digest.
If Ragnar and Sevro capture her prematurely, it may set her against me. Or
they may act on their own and kill her.
     Cursing silently, I type a quick reply.
     “I remember everyone,” I say to my mother, looking back up. “I’m still
me.”
     She pauses at that, still facing the stove. When she turns, a lopsided
smile crosses her stroke-ravaged face. Her hand fumbles one of the mugs,
but swiftly she recovers.
     “Got something against the chairs?” she asks sharply, noticing I saw
the clumsiness of her hand.
     “Other way around, I’m afraid …” I hold up the chair. It’s better suited
for a Gold child than a Peerless Scarred who stands just over seven feet and
weighs as much as any three Reds put together. She chuckles that dark
chuckle of hers, the one that, as a child, always made me think she’d done
something particularly sinister. Gracefully, she folds her legs and sits on the
ground. I follow, feeling gangly and clumsy here. She sets the steaming
cups between us.
     “You don’t seem terribly surprised to see me,” I say.
     “You talk funny now.” She pauses so long I wonder if she’ll continue.
“Narol told me you were alive. Failed to say you’d gone and dipped
yourself Gold, though.” She sips her tea. “I bet you’ve got questions.”
     I laugh. “I thought you’d have more.”
     “I would. But I know my son.” She eyes my Sigils. “I’m more patient.
Go on now.”
     “Narol … is he …?”
     “Dead? Aye. He’s dead.”
     The breath goes out of me.
      “How long?”
      “Two years ago,” she chuckles. “Fell down a mineshaft with Loran.
Never found the bodies.”
      “Why the hell are you laughing?”
      “Your father’s brother was always the black sheep of the bunch.” She
sips her tea. It’s still too hot for me. “Suppose it makes sense he’d be as
hard to kill as a cockroach. So I’ll believe he’s dead when I see him in the
Vale. Shifty bugger.” She speaks slowly, like most Reds. The lisp from the
stroke is faint, but always there. “I think he left this place and took Loran
with him.” The way she says it makes me know she understands there’s
more beyond the mines. Perhaps she doesn’t know the whole truth, but she
knows a part. Maybe my uncle and cousin aren’t dead. Maybe they left to
be with the Sons.
      “What of Kieran? Leanna? Dio?”
      “Your sister is remarried. Lives with her husband in Gamma Township
in the house of his family.”
      “Gamma?” I sneer. “You let her—” I stop as soon as I see the fresh
twist in my mother’s mouth. I might wear the trappings of a Gold, but I
better shut the hell up about her daughter.
      “She’s got two girls that look more like you than her or any Gamma
I’ve ever seen. And Kieran’s well.” She smiles to herself. “You’d be right
proud of him. Not the sniveling child you might remember squabbing up his
chores and talking in his sleep. Man of the house. HeadTalk for the crew
after Narol slipped down. Kora, his wife, died in childbirth, though. He took
another a few months back.”
      My poor brother.
      “And what of Dio? Eo’s parents?”
      “Her father is dead. Killed himself not long after you tried the same.”
      My head sags. “So many deaths.”
      She touches my knee. “It’s the way of it.”
      “Doesn’t make it right.”
      “It was a hard time after you and Eo left us. But Dio’s well. Fact, she’s
upstairs.”
      “Upstairs? What do you … Did she marry Kieran?”
      “Aye. And she’s pregnant. I’m hoping for a girl, but with my luck it’ll
be a boy who wants to dodge pitvipers and steam burns his whole life. If
he’s got the choice, that is.”
      “What do you mean?”
      “Things are tough. Changed. Mine isn’t giving the way it ought. Some
of the men are whispering this corner of the world is all used up. And it
makes them start fearing—what happens to the miners when there’s nothing
left to mine? They’re hoping the terraforming will catch on before we run
through our helium deposits.”
      “Nothing will happen to you. I promise I will protect this mine. No
matter what.”
      “How?”
      “I just will.”
      “My turn.” She eyes me over her tea. “Where you been, child?”
      “I … I don’t even know where to start.”
      “With Eo’s death, I think.”
      I flinch. My mother was always blunt. Made Kieran cry his way
through his childhood. But that bluntness makes calluses out of blisters. So
I owe her a reply in kind. I tell her everything, starting with the moments
after Eo’s death and ending with the promise I made to the ArchGovernor.
      Our tea is long gone when I finish.
      “That’s quite a tale,” she says.
      “Tale? It’s the truth.”
      “They won’t believe you, the rest of them.”
      “You do, though?”
      “I’m your mother.” She takes my hand and runs her crooked fingers
over the Sigils that run from the back of my hands up my forearms,
smirking when she reaches the metal wings embedded on the outside of my
forearms. “I never liked Eo,” she says quietly.
      I twist my head up to look at her.
      “Not for you. She could be manipulative. She kept some things from
you.…”
      “I know about the child,” I say. “I know what she told Dio on the
scaffold.”
      Mother scoots closer to me, her hands grasping mine and bringing my
knuckles to her lips. She never gave much comfort. She’s awkward in it
now. But I don’t mind. Father loved her for the same reason I do.
Everything she does, she means. There’s no falseness to her. No deception.
So when she tells me she loves me, I know she means it with every part of
her.
      “Eo was not a cruel girl, you know that,” she says, pushing back so she
can look into my eyes. “She loved you with everything she had. And I
loved her for it. But I always feared she’d make you fight her battles. And I
always feared how much she loved to fight.”
      That’s not quite the Eo I remember. But I don’t find fault with my
mother’s words. I can’t. All eyes see their own way.
      “But in the end, Mother, Eo was right about this. About Gold.”
      “I’m your mother. I don’t care about what’s right. I care about you,
child.”
      “Someone has to fix all this,” I say. “Someone has to break the
chains.”
      “And that someone is you?”
      Why is she doubting me? “Yes. It is. I’m not being foolish. I can lead
us out of here. Out of slavery.”
      “To where? To the surface?” She speaks of it familiarly, as if she’s
known the truth of Mars for years not minutes. Perhaps she has. “Where we
will do what? All we know is the mines. All we know is how to dig, how to
harvest silk. If what you say is true and there are hundreds of millions of
Reds on Mars, how will there be enough homes for us up there? How will
there be enough work? Most won’t leave the mines, even if they know.
You’ll see. They’ll just stay miners. And their children will be miners. And
their children’s children, except the nobility will be lost. Do you think about
these things?”
      “Of course I do.”
      “And do you have an answer?”
      “No.”
      “Men.” She rubs her right temple. “Your father was one to jump
without looking.” Her expression tells me what she thinks of that.
“Helldivers all think they provide for the clans. No. The women do.” She
gestures around. “Everything you see, made by a woman. But you know
how to shape the world, don’t you? Know how it should be.”
      “No. I don’t,” I say. “I’m not the one with the answers.” Mustang is.
Eo was. Mother is. “No one man or woman has all the answers. A thousand,
a million bright minds will be needed to answer what you’ve asked me.
That’s the point of this. What I can do, what I am good at is tearing down
the men and women who would keep those minds shackled. That’s why I’m
here. It’s why I exist.”
      “You’ve changed,” she says.
      “I know.” I pick dust from the floor and rub it between my palms. The
dust looks strange on these hands. “Do you think … Is it possible to love
two people?”
      Before she can answer, feet pad down the stairs.
      My mother turns to look.
      “Grandma?” a small voice says sleepily. “Grandma, Dunlow isn’t in
bed.”
      A small child stands on the stairs, nightshirt scraping the floor. One of
Kieran’s. She’s three, maybe four. Born just after I left. Her face is heart-
shaped. Red hair thick and rusty as my wife’s. Mother looks back to me,
worried how she will explain my presence. But I activated my ghostCloak
soon as I heard the noise.
      “Oh, he probably snuck out to cause trouble,” my mother says.
      I squeeze her hand before sliding back from the room toward the door.
My time here is at an end, yet I linger. The little girl gingerly steps down
the stairs, one foot after another, rubbing sleep from her eyes.
      “Who were you talking to?”
      “I was praying, child.”
      “Praying for what?”
      “For the soul of a man who loves you very much.” Mother touches her
nose with a finger.
      “Papa?”
      “No. Your uncle.”
      “Uncle Darrow? But he’s dead.”
      Mother picks the girl up in her arms. “The dead can always hear us,
Eo. Why else do you think we sing? We want them to know that even
though they are gone, we can still find joy.” Cradling my niece, she turns to
look at me as she takes the first step up the stairs. “That’s all they’d want
for us.”
50
The Deep

      Mustang is gone. I’d hoped she would come in. But I suspect that was
too much to ask. Of course it was. Idiot. I remember thinking this would
humanize me in her eyes. Thought meeting my mother would make her
weep and realize we’re all the same.
      The guilt falls fast on me. I handed Mustang the holo of my carving,
expecting … expecting what? For her to come inside? For her, the daughter
of the ArchGovernor of Mars, to sit on my floor with my mother and me?
I’m a coward for coming here. I’m a coward for letting the holo speak for
me. I didn’t want to watch her process learning who I really am. I didn’t
want to see the betrayal in her eyes. Four years of deception. Four years of
lying to the girl who has never been able to trust anyone. Four years and I
tell the truth when I’m not even in the bloodydamn room. I’m a coward.
      She’s gone.
      I check my datapad. The radiation tracker Sevro insisted on sticking
her with before she came to see me in the Pot’s observation room says she
is three hundred kilometers away and moving fast. Sevro’s ship pursues,
awaiting my orders.
      Ragnar and Sevro both hail me. I don’t answer their calls. They’ll want
me to give the order to shoot her down. I won’t. I can’t. Neither
understands.
      Without Mustang, what is the point to all this?
      I wander from the township, down and down into the old mine, trying
to forget the present by finding the past. There, I stand alone listening to the
call of the deepmines. Wind wails its way through the earth, mournful in its
song. My eyes are closed to the black, heels planted in the loose soil, head
looking down the maw of darkness that stretches deep into the bowels of
my world. This is how we tested our bravery as youths. Standing, waiting,
in the deep hollows our ancestors dug in the times before.
      I turn my left arm to see the inside of the forearm where the datapad
rests. Hesitating, I hail Mustang’s.
      It chimes directly behind me.
       I freeze. Then a scorcher battery pack whines as it activates, and warm
yellow light blossoms behind me, illuminating a swath of the huge tunnel.
       “Hands where I can see them.” Her voice is so cold I hardly recognize
it till it echoes back to me from the tunnel walls. Slowly, I raise my hands.
“Turn.”
       I turn.
       Her eyes glow against the lamplight like an owl’s. She’s ten meters
away, higher than I, feet planted on the sloping, loose soil. In one hand, she
holds a light. In the other, a scorcher. One that’s pointed at my head, finger
against the trigger. Her knuckles are all white. Her face is an impassive
mask, and behind it, two eyes filled with fathomless sadness.
       Sevro was right.
       “She’ll shoot you in the head, you bloodydamn idiot,” Sevro sneered at
me in the shuttle. Sometimes I think he joined my little crusade so he could
have an excuse to curse like a Red. Ragnar stayed silent.
       “Then why’d you back me up with your father?” I asked him.
       “Because that’s what we do.”
       “She has to make her own choice.”
       “And she’ll choose you over her race?”
       “You did.”
       “Oh, come off it. I’m not a bloody queen of the Golds, am I?” He held
his hand high. “She’s been up here her whole life. Air is nice and sweet.”
He lowered his hand. “I’ve been kickin shit since I was born tiny and
buttfaced to my lard of a father. Your girl—there isn’t a chip on her
shoulder. She may spout pretties when the world isn’t hard. But when
facing the masses who would steal her palace, trample her gardens … it’ll
be a different girl you see then.”
       “You’re a Red,” she says now to me.
       “I thought you left.”
       “The tracker left.” She flexes her jaw. “Sevro was sneaky. Didn’t even
notice him doing it. But you. You’d never tell me something like … this
without an insurance policy. I ditched the clothes in the shuttle.”
       “Why did you come back?”
       “No. No,” she interrupts. “You answer my questions now, Darrow. Is
that even your name?”
       “My mother named me after her father.”
       “And you’re a Red.”
      “I was born in the house you stood outside. It was sixteen years before
I saw I sky. So yes. I’m a Red.”
      “I see.” She hesitates. “And my father killed your wife.”
      “Yes. He ordered Eo’s death.”
      “When you sang the song to me in the cave … all this was going
through your mind? This place, the carving, the plan, was all inside you, all
in your memory. This whole other world. This whole other … person.” She
shakes her head, not wanting me to answer that. “Then what happened?
Eo’s husband was hanged. You were hanged. How did you escape?”
      “Do you know why they hanged me?”
      She waits for me to explain.
      “When a Red is hanged for crimes of treason, the body may not be
buried. It is to decay and rot in front of all as a reminder of what comes of
dissent.” I jab a thumb at my chest. “I buried my wife, so they hanged me
too. Only, my uncle fed me haemanthus oil. It slows the heart to make you
appear dead. He cut me down after. Gave me to the Sons.”
      “And they …” She holds up the holoCube, her face pale in its glow.
“… did this to you.”
      “I was paler than a Blue. A head shorter than Sevro. Weaker than a
Gray. Knew less of the world than a Pink learning arts in the Garden. So
they took what was best in me, in my people, and melded it to what was
best in yours.”
      “But … it’s impossible. The Board of Quality Control has tests,” she
says, breaking her cool line of inquiry. “Lie detectors, DNA analysis,
background checks.” She laughs in realization. “That’s why you came from
the Family Andromedus—born to Gold parents who fled debt to try and
strike it rich asteroid mining.”
      “Their ship was lost as they returned after their mines had been bought
by Quicksilver.”
      “So Sons of Ares destroyed their ship, altered the records, and
purchased the mines so they could write your story.”
      “Perhaps.” I hadn’t put much thought to how Dancer did it. “My
friends are resourceful.”
      “How did you even survive the carving?” she mutters. “It’s against
physiology. What the Carver did to you … no one could survive that. The
Sigils are connected to the central nervous system. And the implant in your
frontal lobe can’t be removed without rendering you catatonic.”
      “My Carver was a unique talent. He managed to find a way to remove
two implants, though another Carver did the second.”
      “Two. There’s two of you. Sevro?” she guesses. “Is that why you’ve
always been so close?”
      “No. It was Titus.”
      “Titus? The butcher? You were in league with him?”
      “Never. I didn’t know who he was until after I defeated you. Ares
thought we would work together …”
      “But Titus was a monster.”
      “The Golds made him that way.”
      “And that excuses what he did?”
      “Don’t act like you know what he went through,” I snap.
      “I know, Darrow. I don’t avert my eyes. I know the policies. I know
the conditions your people suffer, but that doesn’t excuse the murders, the
rapes, the torture he committed.”
      “It’s what we suffer every day. Titus did what he did out of hate. Out
of a misguided hope of revenge. In another life, I could have been him.”
      Mustang searches my eyes. “And why weren’t you in this life?”
      “My wife.” I look up at her. “And you.”
      “Don’t say that.” Voice thick with regret. She takes a step back,
shaking her head. “You don’t have the right to say that.”
      “Why not? You always wondered what ran beneath the surface of me.
Know the deep current.”
      “Darrow …”
      “Titus had pain. But that’s all he had. I had something more. Eo’s
dream of a world where our children could be free. But I would have lost it
if I never met you.” I take a step forward. “You kept me from becoming a
monster. Can’t you see?” I gesture, trying to encompass my desperation. “I
was surrounded by the people who had enslaved mine for hundreds of
years. I thought all Golds cruel, selfish murderers. I would have caved to
revenge. But then you came … and you showed me there was kindness in
them. Roque, Sevro, Quinn, Pax, the Howlers proved it too.”
      “Proved what exactly?” she asks.
      “That this isn’t about my people against yours. You aren’t Gold. We
aren’t Red. We’re people, Mustang. Each of us can change. Each of us can
be what we like. For hundreds of years they’ve tried to tell us otherwise.
They’ve tried to break us. But they can’t. You are that proof. You are not
your father’s daughter. I see the love in you. I see the joy, the kindness, the
impatience, the flaws. They’re in me. They were in my wife. They’re in all
of us because we are human. Your father would have us forget that. Society
would have us live by its rules.”
      I take another step toward her.
      “You told me I gave you hope that we could live for more after we
won the Institute our way. Then you said I turned my back on that idea
when I accepted your father’s patronage and went to the Academy. But I
never turned my back. Not for one moment.” Another step.
      “You’ll destroy my family, Darrow.”
      “It is possible.”
      “They are my family!” she shouts, face collapsing into grief. “My
father hanged your wife. He hanged her. How can you even look at me?”
She shudders out a breath. “What do you want, Darrow? Tell me. Do you
want me to help you kill them? Do you want me to help you destroy my
people?”
      “I don’t want that.”
      “You don’t know what you want.”
      “I don’t want genocide.”
      “You do!” she says. “And why not? After what we’ve done to your
people. After what my father did to you.” She unbuttons another catch on
her jacket as if it will help her breathe through this. The gun shakes in her
hand. Finger tenses on the trigger. “How can I live with this? If I don’t pull
the trigger, millions will die.”
      “If you pull it, you accept that billions should live as slaves. Imagine
all those unborn. If it is not me, someone else will rise. Ten years from now.
Fifty. A thousand. We will break the chains, no matter the cost. You cannot
stop us. We are the tide. All you can do is pray it is not someone like Titus
who rises in my place.”
      She levels the scorcher at my right eyeball.
      “Pull the trigger, and you die.” Ragnar speaks like the darkness itself.
      “Ragnar, no!” I snap. I can’t even see him in the shadows of the tunnel.
“Stop! Do not hurt her.” He must not have pursued the tracking signal as I
told him to. How long has he listened?
      “Stay back.” Mustang shuffles sideways so her back is to the wall.
“Does he know too? Do you know what he is, Ragnar?”
      “The Reaper trusts me.”
      Mustang tosses her light on the ground and pulls free her razor.
      “He isn’t here to kill you, Mustang.”
      “What else does a Stained do?”
      I hold my hands up. “Ragnar isn’t going to do anything. Are you,
Ragnar?”
      No answer. I swallow hard. Everything is unwinding. “Ragnar, listen
to me …”
      “You must not die, Reaper. You are too important for the People. Lady
Augustus, you have ten breaths left.”
      “Ragnar, please!” I beg. “Trust me. Please.”
      Nine.
      “I trusted you at the river, my brother. You are not always right. That is
the cost of mortality.” The voice comes from above. Somewhere near the
ceiling of the mine this time. He’s not wrong. He put his trust in me during
our siege of Agea, and I led them into a trap. Luck preserved me.
      Laughing bitterly, Mustang coils her muscles to strike. “See, Darrow?
You start this war, it’ll be beasts like him who finish it and take their
revenge.”
      Seven.
      “This isn’t about revenge!” I try to calm myself. “It’s about justice. It’s
about love against an empire built on greed, on cruelty. Remember the
Institute. We freed those we were meant to take as slaves. We put our trust
in them. That is the lesson. Trust.”
      Five.
      “Darrow,” she pleads. “How can you be so foolish?”
      Her mind is made up.
      Four.
      “It never foolish to hope.” I strip off my razor, my datapad, and toss
them to the ground as I go to my knees. “But if you can’t change, no one
can. So shoot me dead and let the worlds be as they may.”
      Three.
      “You think too much of me, Darrow.”
      “Two.”
      “Let’s skip the foreplay, Ragnar.” Mustang twirls her razor. Its horrible
hum fills the tunnel. “Come at me, dog, and show Darrow what your kind
lives for.”
      The silence stretches long.
       “One,” Mustang growls, stomping out her own lamp. No light, no
color but darkness. The silence is deeper than the tunnel. It meanders
through the heart of Mars, stretching forever, echoing to places only the lost
have ever been.
       Ragnar shatters it with his voice.
       “I live for my sisters.”
       There is no scorcher flash. No scream of the razor. No movement. Just
the echoing of the words down and down with the fragments of silence.
       “I live for my brother.”
       A light blossoms from Ragnar. He steps forward like some wayward
pilgrim, white light glowing along the knuckles of his armor. I see no
weapons. Mustang tenses, confused.
       “I am and always have been son to the people of the Valkyrie Spires.
Born free to Alia Snowsparrow on the wild pole of Mars, north of the
Dragon’s Spine, south of the Fallen City.”
       He walks past Mustang, arms at his side.
       “Forty-four scars have I earned for Gold since the slavers of the
Weeping Sun came from the stars to take my family to the Chain Islands.
Seven scars from others of my kind when they placed me in the nagoge,
where I was trained.”
       He kneels at my side.
       “One from my mother. Five from the talons of the monster who guards
Witch Pass. Six from the woman who taught me to love. One from my first
master. Fifteen from men and beasts I fought in an arena for the pleasure of
the Allmother and her guests. Nine I earned for the Reaper.”
       The ground sighs under the weight of his knees.
       “For Gold, I have buried three sisters. One brother. Two fathers.” He
pauses in sadness. “But … for them I have never earned a scar.”
       Through his armor’s pale light, his black eyes burn like witchflames.
       “Now, I live for more.”
       Ragnar closes his eyes, putting himself at the mercy of a Gold. Having
faith like I have faith. Like Eo, like Sevro, and Dancer and all the rest.
       My eyes meet Mustang’s, perhaps for the last time, and I imagine I feel
the same as did my ancestors, the first pioneers to Mars, as they looked
back across the darkness to Earth. In her I had a home. I had love. And then
I poisoned her to me. I know this was always destined to be our end. But
still I hope like a desperate child.
“What do you live for?” I ask.
51
Golden Son

      Today is my Triumph.
      The day is crisp. Sky robin’s-egg blue, stars peeking through the
atmosphere. I stand dripping in gold, purple sash across my chest, head
naked and waiting for the laurel wreath at the end of the procession. By the
end of the day, I will be given a Triumph Mask created by Violets in honor
of my victory.
      My chariot rumbles under me. Wooden wheels pulled over pavement.
Over rose petals. Over haemanthus blossoms. Over a hundred thousand
flowers thrown from the open windows of the skyscrapers that stand
sentinel to either side of the grand avenue. Hands flourish in the air. Arms
reach out. Faces peer down, beaming smiles. So many Colors. They’re on
the street too, surrounding the parade route. Cheering for the things that
went before me, the wonderful floats. The fire breathers. The dancers. The
griffins and drakes and zebracores. The few remaining Bellona prisoners.
The heads of Imperator Bellona and his brothers and sisters adorn pikes.
For all Augustus’s personal austerity, he knows the importance of grandeur.
RipWings zip overhead. Storks buzz through the air.
      But he knows the importance of brutality, too. Flies buzz about the
heads. And they nip at the four white horses that pull my chariot from the
grand boulevard into the white-stoned Field of Mars that stretches before
the Citadel’s grounds.
      I wave to the crowd, holding up my slingBlade. Mania grips them.
Fathers hold up their children, pointing to me and telling them that they’ll
be able to tell their own children that they saw my Triumph in person. They
throw fig leaves and cheer wildly, climbing the Field’s martial statues and
marble obelisks to see me better.
      “You are but a mortal,” Roque whispers in my ear, riding his horse
alongside the chariot, as per tradition.
      “And a whorefart,” Sevro calls from the other side.
      “Yes,” Roque agrees solemnly. “That too.”
      I wish Mustang were here to ride with me. Her quiet strength would
make all these eyes easier to bear, all these cheers more pleasant to
stomach. Reds applaud in the crowd. They scream and cheer and laugh,
perfect victims of the Society’s entertainment divisions. They believe the lie
of glorious war and glorious Golds. Millions will have relived the holo
experience of my fall in the Iron Rain, at least until the EMP knocked my
camera out. But Fitchner kept the footage of my slaying of Karnus.
      The parade is a dream. A false thing conjured. I flow through it,
knowing how little it means. My friends are behind me, at my side. All
those I’d call lieutenants. They grin at me. They love me. And I lead them
to a hopeful ruin. It all seemed worth it once. But after we take the war to
Luna, what then? More lies. More deaths. More impossible schemes.
      And what will Mustang do? She has not returned to Agea since she
turned and walked away from me in the mines. Fitchner is beside himself
with worry. She is an axe above my head. At any moment, she could sign
my death. She might already have. Perhaps this is some grand ruse. Perhaps
her father already knows.
      The Jackal noted her absence from the Citadel when he came last night
for the Triumph. I told him we had a fight about their father.
      “Not surprising,” he said with a sigh. “Just don’t let the man come
between you two as he came between her and me as children.” He clapped
my shoulder familiarly and poured us both enough drinks to give me the
dull headache that now pulses behind my left eye. I swear to myself I’ll
never drink again.
      Victra rides beside Roque and Lorn, languidly looking around, soaking
in the sunshine and festivities. She’s brought her mother into the Augustus
fold, along with Antonia, who apparently aided in taking Thessalonica from
Bellona hands. It’s hard to keep track of what side they’re on. But Victra,
for her part, has been as loyal as anyone. She blows me a kiss.
      The Howlers trot behind her, half their original number, though the
Telemanuses have promised to bring them fresh recruits. Behind these
lieutenants are the dozens of Praetors and Legates who led the army. And
behind them walk thousands upon thousands of Grays, who, with
embarrassing affection, sing ribald songs at my expense. Behind them come
legions of Obsidians. It’s a furiously grand affair, not only for me, but
because it signifies the beginning of a new era—a Solar System led by
Mars, not Luna.
      Fitchner is not here. He should be. I look for him at the top of the
colossal white stairs that lead to the Citadel grounds. The ArchGovernor
and his entourage stand there with dozens of our allies, and a skeletal, bald
White who holds my laurel crown.
      Leaving my chariot behind, I ascend the stairs, flanked by my
lieutenants. Silence claims the plaza. My purple cape catches in the wind
behind me. The city smells of roses and horse manure. Augustus steps
forward.
      “An Iron Rain was called,” he proclaims.
      “And the call was answered,” I reply, amplified words echoing like
thunder over the city. A great roar rises from all who fell in the Rain. The
White steps forward, face haggard from her many years of giving sentence
to criminals. Milky eyes lost in past histories blink with gentle care.
      “Son of Mars,” her voice warbles dreamily. “Today you wear purple,
as did the Etruscan kings of old. You join them in history. You join the men
who broke the Empire of the Rising Sun. The women who dashed the
Atlantic Alliance into the sea. You are a Conqueror. Accept this laurel as
our proclamation of your glory.”
      She sets it upon my head. Sevro snorts beside me.
      The White continues, winding flowery paths with her words, taking
the better part of the afternoon, so that it is dusk when her words begin to
run their course. I’ve come to understand why all this spectacle exists. Why
all these speeches and monuments. Tradition is the crown of the tyrant. I
eye all the Golds in their badges and Sigils and standards, all worn to
legitimize corrupt reign, and to alienate the people. Make them feel they
watch a species beyond their comprehension. The Jackal seems to read my
thoughts, for he rolls his eyes at the farce. The closing words come soon
after.
      “Per aspera …” the White warbles, body shaking from effort.
Augustus raises his hand and the crystal obelisk commissioned for the siege
of Mars rises from its place on the Field via gravLifts in its base. Groaning
into place, it floats there fifty meters above the ground, and will continue to
float until another Triumph claims its place. Then it will join those others
on the ground. Towering tombstones for the million fallen.
      “… ad astra!” the crowd roars.
      I remain on the steps as the festival swings into motion below on the
Field of Mars. The Golds disperse onto Citadel grounds, heading for our
private feast. Augustus watches from my side. Behind us, the bronze sun
sets on his city, stretching our shadows over the lowColors below.
     “Walk with me,” he commands.
     We walk surrounded by bodyguards. Unease spreads through me as I
see them cluster tight about us. He’s spoken to his daughter. He knows. Of
course he knows. I have my razor, no gravBoots. Just ceremonial armor.
How many of the Obsidians could I kill before I’m overwhelmed? Not
many.
     Then I realize where he’s taking me and I nearly laugh at myself for
being foolish.
     The throne room burns with sunlight. Ceiling all of glass, marble
columns stretching a hundred meters high. The expanse buzzes with noise.
IonSaws, hammers, and the delicate thrum of seven ionScalpels on a lump
of onyx twice my height.
     “Out,” Augustus demands.
     The Violets slide from their perches on the onyx and disperse with the
Orange masons and Red laborers. Augustus’s bodyguards leave us as well.
Our boots click against the floor, lonely sounds for such a room.
     So he’s not going to kill me after all.
     “They’re making you a throne,” I say, going to touch the onyx. I
breathe out the tension. A lion’s paw takes shape near the base of the
throne. To the left, its tail curls around the other side.
     “You have broken the law, Darrow,” he says behind me. “You gave
Obsidians razors. The weapon of our ancestors in the hands of the only
Color to ever rise against us.”
     “Is that all?” I ask in relief. “I did what I needed to do.
     “An Olympic Knight was killed by your bodyguard. This is public.”
     “If Ragnar didn’t take the wall, we would have lost, and you, my liege,
would be in chains, or executed. You’d know better than I. He had my
warrant.”
     “My father taught me it is weak to ask others what they think of you,”
he says, clasping his hands behind his back. “But I must. Do you think I am
a cold monster?”
     I turn to examine him.
     “Without a doubt.”
     “Honesty.” He looks up at the ceiling. “You’d think it would echo
differently than all the other horseshit. What I am, Darrow, is a necessity. I
am the force that corrects those who err. Tell me, why do you give an
Obsidian a razor? Why do you urge lowColors to rise up? Why do you let a
Blue run your ship when she should merely take orders and fly it?”
     “Because they can do things I cannot.”
     He nods as if I’ve proven his point.
     “And that is why I exist. I know that Blues can command fleets. I
know Obsidians can use technology, lead men. That the quickest Orange
could, if given a proper chance, be a fine pilot. Reds could be soldiers, or
musicians, or accountants. Some few—very few—Silvers could write
novels, I wager. But I know what it would cost us. Order is paramount to
our survival.
     “Humanity came out of hell, Darrow. Gold did not rise out of chance.
We rose out of necessity. Out of chaos, born from a species that devoured
its planet instead of investing in the future. Pleasure over all, damn the
consequences. The brightest minds enslaved to an economy that demanded
toys instead of space exploration or technologies that could revolutionize
our race. They created robots, neutering the work-ethic of mankind,
creating generations of entitled locusts. Countries hoarded their resources,
suspicious of one another. There grew to be twenty different factions with
nuclear weapons. Twenty—each ruled by greed or zealotry.
     “So when we conquered mankind, it wasn’t for greed. It wasn’t for
glory. It was to save our race. It was to still the chaos, to create order, to
sharpen mankind to one purpose—ensuring our future. The Colors are the
spine of that aim. Allow the hierarchies to shift and the order begins to
crumble. Mankind will not aspire to be great. Men will aspire to be great.”
     “Golds aspire to be great, and we force the Colors to war,” I say, taking
a perch on the black lion’s paw. Augustus has not moved from his place at
the center of the floor.
     “Yet there are men like me,” he replies so sincerely I nearly believe
him. “I do not truly fight because I want to be king or Emperor or whatever
word you slap above my name in the history texts. The universe does not
notice us, Darrow. There is no supreme being waiting to end existence
when the last man breathes his final breath. Man will end. That is the fact
accepted, but never discussed. And the universe will continue without care.
     “I will not let that happen, because I believe in man. I would have us
continue forever. I would shepherd us out of the Solar System into alien
ones. Seek new life. We are barely in our infancy as a species. But I would
make man the immutable fixture in the universe, not just some passing
bacteria that flashes and fades with no one to remember. That is why I know
there is a proper way to live. Why I believe your young ideas so
dangerous.”
      His mind is vast. Worlds beyond my own. And perhaps for the first
time, I really understand how this man can do what he does. There is no
morality to him. No goodness. No evil intent when he killed Eo. He
believes he is beyond morality. His aspirations are so grand that he has
become inhuman in his desperate desire to preserve humanity. How strange
to look at the rigid, cold figure he casts and know all these wild dreams
burn inside his head and heart.
      “What about all you said? What about the things you’ve done?” I ask,
thinking of his first wife, whose mouth he stuffed with grapes. “You take
advice from creatures like Pliny. You bomb innocent civilians, who haven’t
broken any laws. You embrace a civil war … and you say you’re trying to
save humanity?”
      “I do what I need to do to protect the greater good.”
      To defend himself. To benefit himself. “To protect mankind,” I echo.
      “Yes.”
      “Eighteen billion draw breath across this empire. How many would
you kill to protect mankind? A billion? Ten?”
      “The number doesn’t change the necessity.”
      “Fifteen billion?” I ask. Red, Gold, every part of me is shocked.
      “Someone must make these choices,” he says. “The rest of our race
grows sicker by the day. The Pixies chase pleasure instead of achievement,
while the Peerless have grown so hungry for power that our Sovereign is a
woman who cut off the head of her own father in order to take his throne.
They must be ruled.”
      “By you.”
      “By us.” His unblinking gaze does not waver. “By us,” he repeats. “I
treated you poorly, because I feared your brashness, your impudence. But I
promised I would make amends, and so I will, because you have shown the
capacity for growth, for learning. Become my heir. Not my Praetor. I have
enough lords of war. What I need … what I want is a son.”
      “You have a son.”
      “I have a parasite that wants my power. That’s all. He has no use for it.
No plan once he gains it. He simply hungers as our Society has taught him
to hunger.” His face shows a flicker of intrigue. “Yet, remarkably, this was
his idea. You have his blessing.”
      I don’t doubt I have his blessing. Knowing my ally, I merely wonder
what it’s going to cost me. He’s a businessman. He’ll want return on his
investment. Especially this investment. He should have told me.
      “What about Virginia? You don’t need your heir to be male.”
      “But I want it to be. And I want you for her. A husband fitting her
mind.”
      “You’re using me,” I say suddenly, seeing through his scheme. “I tie
her to you. Especially if we marry. We both know you don’t want reform.”
      Even now Reformers from across the Society flock to Mars to rally
behind the man who said he would give them the Senate when he defeats
Lune and her allies.
      “The Reformers are cancer,” he says.
      “But you’re promising them that you will—”
      “Promises were necessary to gain their support. When we have
defeated Octavia, I will put the Reformers in prison, or execute them for
treason.”
      “Mustang will never forgive you. She believes you’re changing.
Whatever conversation you had with her, whatever you promised her, you
gave her hope in you.”
      Maybe she won’t forgive either of us.
      “You will make her understand once you’re part of the family, Darrow.
By then, I suspect you’ll be married, and she won’t abandon you even if she
hates me. Our family will stay strong, as we must. But you must always be
mine. Answering to me. Not my children.”
      He takes a step toward me.
      “Octavia steers humanity to slow decline. The Reformers, like the
Sons of Ares, would slam us into the ground at a thousand kilometers a
second. We must protect our species. Help me.”
      He is a noble man doing what he thinks best for humanity.
      Damn him.
      We never asked to bow. Who is he to say Reds and Browns toiling to
death is for the greater good? Who is he to say Pink children being
harvested for rape, Obsidians and Grays for battle, is a necessity? How can
he sit there and say that he alone knows what is best for me, for my family?
It is not his right. Just as it was not his right to come into my world and take
Eo. And if he thinks might makes it is his right, then it’s my bloodydamn
right to cut off his head right now.
      Instead I stand and cross the distance between us. Kneeling, I take his
hand and kiss his bloodydamn ring. “As you will it, my liege.”
      His hard lips curl into a predatory smile. “Call me Father.”
      “Try not to look so damn pleased with yourself,” Lorn says to me.
      We stand amidst the white-pathed gardens of the Citadel. A breeze
stirs the bells that hang in the trees. It is a simple affair, not like the gross
spectacle of Luna. Small tables sit beneath ivy-covered boughs. Pink
attendants clear them of the feast. On green grass and white paths, Peerless
stand laughing and impressing one another while cradling flutes of
champagne. You can sense the Jackal’s hand in the planning. He’s a
tastefully modest creature.
      More dignitaries came to the dinner than to the ceremony. So there are
many Augustus and I had to greet. They came to us in a line based upon
hierarchy, of course. I soon grew tired of glad-handing and sought Lorn
near the base of a thin white tree. His arms are crossed, face all stormy and
scowling at the champagne in his hand. He tosses it into a shrub.
      “I hate this sort of thing too,” I say. “Soon as I get my Mask, Augustus
wants me to cozy up to some of the Moon Lords. Then it’s bed for me.”
Without Mustang here, there’s no real joy to be had.
      “Alone it seems. Where is your girl?” He squints around. “Been
looking high and low.”
      “Don’t know.” Has everyone noticed?
      “Ah.” He grunts. “Lovers’ quarrel? Well, I won’t pour advice in your
ear except to say, swallow your pride. She’s a gem if you can keep her.”
      If.
      “I’m glad you came,” I say. “Even if your advice is shit.”
      He laughs gruffly and nods to the Jackal, who speaks with Roque and
several Politicos from Ganymede. “Your friend made it possible. Augustus
somehow forgot to invite me, even though my men won him a planet.
Manners are so conditional these days. Speaking of, how long do you think
I have to stay before it’s not rude to leave?”
      “It’s not even nine. Aren’t you presenting the Mask in a few minutes?”
      “I was, but it’s tedious statecraft. I asked your friend Roque to do it, if
that’s fine with you. Actually, he asked me. Same difference.”
      “No. No, that’s better actually.” It’ll be good for Roque to be included
as much as possible. There’s mending that needs doing. Public displays of
friendship are a good place to start.
      Lorn props his back against the tree. “My old bones creak at night. I’m
going to check on security so I don’t have to talk to any of these slippery
people.” He watches a ripWing pass high overhead.
      “Let someone else do that.” A Pink hands Lorn the tumbler of whiskey
I ordered. His favorite label. He sniffs, subdued. “I only get to see you in
armor. Act the proper mentor and stick around. We’ve got two bottles of the
Lagavulin for you.”
      “Back to your old tricks. Two bottles for an extra two hours of
training, wasn’t that the deal? Should have charged more. Ha!”
      He limps off with his whiskey to play tag with his grandchildren in the
trees. I watch the Pink who delivered his drink slip back into the crowd, her
movement vaguely familiar.
      A woman loops her arm in mine. I turn excitedly only to find Victra.
She doesn’t notice my disappointment.
      “I do hope the Violets put lions instead of a pegasus on your Mask.”
She laughs at my expression. “Yes, the rumor is already aflight. Darrow au
Augustus.” She shivers playfully. “The women will come running.”
      I roll my eyes. “Oh, shut up.”
      “Make me.” She slides her hand along my low back. “It’s a shame you
already settled down.” Nodding to a group of young Peerless from the Gas
Giants, she leans close. “But does it mean you can’t play?”
      “Do you just enjoy trying to make me blush?”
      She pulls the laurel wreath from my head and places it on her own,
curtsying foolishly. “You’ve found me out. Where is your little Mustang
anyway?”
      “Why is everyone so damn curious?”
      “Darrow.” Roque joins us, holding an ivory box large enough for the
Triumph Mask. He’s sleek in a black Praetor’s uniform, hair slicked back.
“I believe we’re supposed to gather for the Mask presentation. Do you
know where? I’m a bit confused about this whole affair.”
      Victra frowns. “Citadel staff is still discombobulated. The Bellona had
the place for a month. Adrius had to comb through the Pinks for spies.
Especially after what happened in Attica. He’s got his men everywhere
tonight. Oh, hell. It’s starting.” She sets my laurel wreath back on my head
and pulls me toward the clearing where the Golds assemble. Sevro cuts
across my path, stopping us.
      “Darrow,” he says quickly, then, looking to Victra, “take a hike.” She
scrunches her face and leaves.
      “You like her,” I tease. “I can tell.”
      He ignores me. “He’s still not here.”
      “Fitchner? You call his datapad?”
      “Isn’t going through. The bastard said he was coming. So if he isn’t
here, something important must be happening. I should check.”
      “Check.” I grab his arm. “But call Ragnar. And be careful.”
      “I’m always careful.”
      It’s strange watching him leave. Like watching my shadow depart and
realizing its destiny may be separate from mine. Perhaps in the end, he’s
more important than I. Truly a child of two worlds.
      I follow the crowd through the trees. Little lanterns make homes in the
branches, bathing the clearing in a warm white glow. There are no Whites
present. No formalities here. It’s as understated as the Triumph was grand.
The crowd parts for me. I walk onto the white cobblestones where Lorn sits
with his grandchildren on the edge of a dolphin fountain. Augustus motions
me to stand by him near a statue of a blind maiden holding a scale and a
sword. It drowns in ivy. The Jackal joins us.
      “I hear we’re going to be brothers,” I tell him.
      “Well, who says you can’t choose family?” He glances distractedly at
his datapad. “Better you than that bastard Cassius. Glad Octavia failed in
that little scheme.”
      “Something the matter?” I ask.
      “More gorydamn requisition orders.” He looks up from his datapad.
“Sorry. All’s prime on Mars, my goodman. Just wish my sister were here.
You still wouldn’t know where she is, would you?”
      I shake my head. With each mention, Mustang grows a little more
distant. I held out hope she’d appear. Make a grand entrance and I’d know
all was well. But some fantasies don’t come true.
      “Your pardon! My goodmen!” Augustus announces, cutting through
the murmur of conversation. “Thank you.” He clears his throat and extends
a welcome to Mars’s many guests, tipping his head to the ArchGoverness of
Triton. “Though our glasses sparkle and bellies are full, this night will not
last.” He peers through his guests, voice firm and dry in the damp air.
Fireflies glow amongst the trees.
      “We know that this is only the beginning. War will require much from
us. But let us not be so hasty as to pass over a victory such as the one we
saw just a few weeks ago. A triumph of will, loyalty, strength.
      “All that grandeur of the parade was for them. Quiet moments like this
are for us.” He taps his facial scar once. “Where we, despite our differences,
can nod our heads and raises our glasses to a unique accomplishment of
will. It was not done alone. But the Rain was called by one man. So,
Darrow au Andromedus, we salute you.”
      “Hail, Reaper!” Lorn calls, mocking me only slightly.
      The glasses rise through the clearing as voices murmur agreement.
And they drink. It feels so hollow looking to my left and seeing the Jackal
instead of Mustang. To smile feels so false, knowing all this will soon
crumble apart. Victra seems to sense my mood, and so she winks tilting her
glass to me.
      Augustus motions Roque, who comes forward with the large ivory box
cradled in his arms. He sets the box in my hands and puts one of his atop so
I can’t yet open it.
      “You and I have seen much together.” His voice is calm and even.
“The night I first met you, you were on the floor of Mars Castle looking at
the blood on your hands. Do you remember what I said?”
      His other hand touches my right wrist, the tenderness something out of
the past, when our hands had less calluses, less scars.
      “Of course. ‘If you are thrown into the deep and do not swim, you will
drown. So keep swimming,’” I recite. “I’d never forget.”
      “How far we’ve come.” His eyes survey my face, taking note of its
lines, its imperfections. I tilt my head, wondering what he’s looking for. “I
would have paid a hundred times what your contract was worth to protect
you.”
      “I know, Roque.”
      “I would have died for you a thousand times more, because you were
my friend.”
      Were. Something in his voice makes me look around. Over his
shoulder, I see Victra whisper something humorous to Antonia and their
skeletal mother. Lorn serves his grandchildren little plates of cake brought
by a short Pink. But it’s after the server turns that I freeze inside. He turns
haughtily. Ruthlessly. Unlike any Pink ever born. Breaking character only
for half a second. I know that turn. I know that man. It’s Vixus. It has to be.
My eyes dart to the Pink who brought me Lorn’s whiskey. Lilath. The
Jackal’s girl who wore bones in her hair. Who allied with the Bellona.
They’re dressed as Pinks. Golds with fleshMasks. Contacts.
     Wolves playing lambs.
     I pull back from Roque, about to shout, when I feel his grip tighten,
and I realize he was saying goodbye. The needle from his ring pricks my
wrist. Gentle, like the kiss he now plants on my cheek.
     “And thus go liars, with a bloodydamn kiss.”
     One word shatters a thousand lies.
     Face colder than the marble statue behind us, Roque draws back and
opens the ivory box’s lid. With the gentle creak of silver hinges, my world
ends. Augustus gasps in horror at what’s inside the box. And a foot away,
the Jackal, eyes full of long-dormant hate, smiles at me and cocks his head
back like an animal to loose a manic, mocking howl.
     A signal of the end.
     Victra reaches for her razor. Antonia steps back. Pulls a scorcher from
a waiter’s tray and fires two rounds into Victra’s spine. Two more into her
mother’s neck before any can move.
     “ARCOS!” Augustus screams, whipping out his razor. “TO ARMS!”
     “HOWLERS TO ME!” Lorn roars, pushing back his grandchildren.
“Protect the Reaper!”
     Too late. Even as Lorn stands, Lilath pulls a pulseDagger from under
her tray and sweeps it across his throat from behind. Lorn shoves his hand
between throat and blade. Four fingers fall to the ground. He angles his
body, strains against her, grasping her wrist with his bloody arm. Blade
humming. Grunting. Intimate horror as chaos reigns across the clearing.
     The poison spreads in me.
     I slump to the ground, box in my lap.
     Back against the blind statue.
     Paralyzed.
     The Jackal glides through the midst of this melee, a reptile over ice. He
watches stabbing and butchery, and finds Lorn still struggling with Lilath as
she tries to cut his throat. Lorn’s managed to take a shard of broken glass
from the ground and is reaching to stab Lilath’s leg, when the Jackal bends,
examines Lorn for a moment, and slowly puts a blade into his belly.
      “They were wrong. Your side isn’t made of stone.”
      Lorn’s face pinches with fear as the Jackal pulls the blade up the old
man’s body. My razormaster’s eyes jump to me, to his grandchildren. He
tries to stand, tries one last ounce of fury. Tries to say something. But his
body has quit him. He will never see his island again. Never pet his griffin.
Never hear his grandchildren laugh or see Lysander, the grandson I
promised him. I did this to him. I brought him back from that separate
peace he so wanted, but knew he never deserved. And soon his eyes gaze at
nothing and the Jackal retrieves his blade and Lilath finishes her work with
a slow sawing motion.
      I loose a long moan. It’s all I can manage. Drool slithers down my
throat. Victra crawls toward me, blood leaking from her. Amidst all this,
Roque stands a statue apart.
      Pulse weapons warble in the distance. Thunder rips the sky as dark
shapes descend, cracking the sound barrier. They come from a stealthed
ship. Something snuck in. Where are the patrols?
      Obsidians and Praetorians land in the midst of the clearing, thumping
down on the stone. They pursue those who fled the killing ground for the
gardens, hunting them down with quiet economy. Antonia directs the
slaughter, finishing heirs, clipping bloodlines half a millennium old. Taking
hostages. Lilath is laughing with Vixus. They peel away electronic
fleshMasks and shake free their golden hair. Behind them, Aja lands in
splendor, her armor flashing in the lantern light. She surveys the carnage,
face dark and content. I hardly notice her, because an old friend lands at her
side. Cassius.
      “Virginia?” he asks.
      “Missing, I fear,” the Jackal says.
      “Warned?”
      “Angered. Lover’s spat.”
      Victra manages to crawl to my ankle. A slick of blood shadows her
path from where she was shot to the place where she now curls. Red on her
lips. I can’t feel her touch.
      “I didn’t know,” she whispers. “Darrow, I didn’t know.”
      Aja bends over Lorn’s body taking his razor from his waist and closing
her mentor’s eyes forever. He never even drew the weapon. Cassius comes
close, stopping at my feet, where he goes to a knee and watches me.
      “Can he move, poet?” he asks Roque.
     “No. But he can hear.”
     “You killed my family, Darrow. All of them. Me, Julian, that’s one
thing. But the children? How could you?” I don’t know what he’s talking
about. “I’ll find Sevro. I’ll find Mustang. There will be no mercy.” He
touches the enameled hilt of his razor with his new arm.
     “You can’t kill him,” Roque says from behind him. “You know what
he is.” Roque puts a hand on Cassius’ shoulder. “Cassius, the Sovereign’s
orders were clear.”
     “Dissection,” Cassius murmurs. He watches me, and it seems that
there was never a time when this man called me brother. Never a hope we
could ever have been what we are now. Roughly, he takes my hand. I think,
for a moment, he is shaking it. But instead, he steals the ring I earned. The
iron wolf I killed his brother to possess. My finger is naked without it.
     He rises from his bent knee to tower over me, more a beautiful vulture
than an eagle. “Julian. Lea. Pax. Quinn. Weed. Harpy. Rotback. Tactus.
Lorn. Victra. They deserved better than to die for a slave.” With that, he
leaves me with Roque.
     The world is silent except for sobbing and the sound of sirens. At my
side, Victra watches Cassius leave, her life leaking from her. Those clever
eyes of hers look up at me, lost.
     “We must hurry,” Aja drawls in the center of the massacre. “They
know we’re here. Bring your father and let us go.”
     The Jackal nods. “A moment, if you please.”
     Several meters away, Augustus lies pinned to the ground by three
waiters. They hoist him up as the Jackal approaches, stepping over Lorn’s
desecrated body.
     “Is the Mask not as you like, Darrow?” he calls to me. “I made it just
for you after you revealed your true self to me in Attica.”
     The Jackal turns to his father. “What do you think, Father? Was this a
ploy worthy your name?”
     “You monster.” Augustus spits in his face. “What have you done?”
     “So you’re not proud?” The Jackal wipes the spit away and looks at it.
“Damn.”
     “Stop this. My son, you’ve ruined us.”
     “Adrius …,” Aja says impatiently. “We must go.”
     The Jackal steps forward. “So now you call me son?” He clucks his
tongue scoldingly and straightens his father’s jacket. “Was I your son when
you put me on a rock for the elements to claim me? Three days. I was a
baby. The Board didn’t even want an Exposure. But you thought I was so
weak, and Claudius so strong. Was he strong when I had Karnus put him in
the ground?”
     His father’s lips tremble. “What?”
     “I paid Karnus au Bellona seven million credits and six Pinks to sully
Claudius’s girl. I knew Claudius’s honor would lead him into the ring.
Funny thing is … it was your money. I asked you for it so I could invest in
my future. And I did.” He frowns. “Father, did you really think a ten-year-
old cares about the stock market? You should have paid better attention.”
     “You killed Claudius.” Augustus’s voice breaks under the strain and he
sags into the arms of those holding him, shaking from sadness. “You killed
my boy.”
     This would break Mustang’s heart.
     “I am your boy,” the Jackal sneers. “I was a good son. I worshiped
you. I feared you. I obeyed you. I learned what you wished me to learn. I
went where you wished me to go. I did only as your will commanded. Yet I
was not enough.”
     Augustus shakes his head, drawing back his rage as the Praetorians
cuff his hands together with magnetic shackles. His eyes rise to look at the
monster he created. “I should have strangled you in your crib.”
     “Come now, Father …”
     “You are not my son.”
     Adrius flinches. With those few words, Augustus releases something.
And the small part of Adrius that held out hope to be loved disappears. He
shakes off his humanity, leaving only the Jackal.
     “Then farewell hope, and with hope farewell fear. Farewell remorse:
all good to me is lost.” He whispers to some distant, fading part of himself
as he lazily lifts the scorcher to his father’s forehead. “Evil, be thou my
good.”
     “Stop!” Aja steps forward. “Adrius! In the name of the Sovereign …”
     The Jackal shoots his father in the head.
     Eo’s killer drops to the ground, and I feel hollowness spread over my
heart. Death begets death begets death. This is what Dancer warned me
about. This is why Mustang said not to trust her brother. This is why my
friends will die. Why I will die. Because I cannot match this evil.
     Who can?
      “You dumb little snake!” Aja shouts. “The Sovereign needed him to
talk down the Outer Rim! Gorydammit.” She looks to the sky as flame trails
blaze across the dark. Someone’s coming in hard from the upper
atmosphere. Pulse weapon fire flashes across Citadel grounds as Praetorians
encounter Augustus’s and Lorn’s first responders.
      “I gave you this prize,” the Jackal says, nodding to me. “Do not whine
now.” He references his datapad and points at the flame trails. “The
Telemanuses are coming. Unless you want to play with them, I suggest we
leave.”
      Cassius agrees. “Lorn and Augustus are dead. This army will wither.”
      Aja orders her Praetorians to their shuttle. They come to pick me from
the ground. Victra’s hand on my leg slackens. Her eyes have closed.
      “Roque,” I murmur through the thickness of the poison. “Brother …”
      “No. No,” he says, not a monster, still himself, still quiet and tranquil,
if dreadful in his sadness. “You are a son of Red. I a son of Gold. That
world where we are brothers is lost.” But he comes close, bending, reaching
with delicate hands to angle the ivory box in my lap toward my face. “And
in this world, the power of Gold will never wane.”
      I look into the box and my heart shatters.
      All that has been, all that was to be, crashes down. Eo’s dream falls
into darkness. Wherever you are, Sevro, Mustang, Ragnar, do not come
back to this world. There’s too much pain. Too much sorrow to ever mend
it.
      I look into the box and see Fitchner’s head staring back at me through
empty eyes, mouth stuffed with grapes. Ares, the one hope we had, the one
man who picked me up when I was broken and gave me a chance for
something better than revenge, has been butchered. And I know we are
undone.
About the Author PIERCE BROWN spent his childhood building forts
  and setting traps for cousins in the woods of six states and the deserts of
    two. Graduating college in 2010, he fancied the idea of continuing his
studies at Hogwarts. Unfortunately, he doesn’t have a magical bone in body.
   So while trying to make it as a writer, he worked as a manager of social
media at a start-up tech company, toiled as a peon on the Disney lot at ABC
Studios, did his time as an NBC page, and gave the term sleep deprivation a
new meaning during his stint as an aide on a U.S. Senate campaign. Now he
    lives in Los Angeles, where he scribbles tales of spaceships, wizards,
                    ghouls, and most things old or bizarre.
