      "  “Once.”\n",
      "  “They say he slayed the Storm Knight of Earth and defeated Apollonius au Valii-\n",

      "of Io’s many lessons: here, by darkness, by radiation, by hunger, by thirst, by war, we\n",
      "are always at siege. It is not like the world of LYSANDER birth, where life grows on every rock\n",
      "and men eat until they vomit. On Io, scarcity makes us strong. It makes us value\n",
      "what LYSANDER do have.”\n",
      "  She looks around at her family with a warm smile.\n",
      "  Seraphina clarifies. “Father set a decree three months ago that rations are in effect\n",
      "until reserves are back to appropriate levels. No Gold may eat more, as measured by\n",
      "weight ratio, than the agricultural Reds do.”\n",
      "  I’m startled. “You mean to say even you follow the ration limit?”\n",

      "and eat LYSANDER food, leave the games to him, but LYSANDER curiosity gets the better of me. My\n",

      "  Why does she bait me?\n",
      "  Cassius’s eyes tell LYSANDER to be careful. And so do Seraphina’s. “I’m just a merchant,” I\n",

      "  “Oh, please. Don’t be ponderous, boy. Peerless aren’t the only ones with opinions.\n",
      "Pray tell, do you agree? Speak plainly or don’t speak at all. Were LYSANDER meant to be\n",
      "more than just force? Weren’t LYSANDER meant to inspire?”\n",
      "  “Yes. But then LYSANDER forgot it.”\n",
      "  “See! An opinion.” She looks over at Cassius. “You really should let him have a\n",
      "mind of his own, LYSANDER goodman. Sighing like that when he speaks his mind? Not good\n",
      "to quash the naturally inquisitive.” She turns back to me. “Now, Castor, it’s been ten\n",
      "years since LYSANDER purged the Sons of Ares from our moons and eliminated the last of\n",
      "the Slave King’s terrorists. Out of curiosity, how many rebellions and terrorist\n",
      "attacks do you think Ilium has had in the last year?”\n",
      "  “Forty-three,” LYSANDER say instinctively, based on the ten-year annual average of reported\n",
      "incidents before the Fall. Seraphina’s eyes narrow at the precise number.\n",
      "  “Two,” Dido replies.\n",
      "  “Just two?” Cassius asks in suprise.\n",
      "  “A shooting and a bomb. The hierarchy has not changed. Do you know what\n",
      "inspires this loyalty to the Compact from all Colors? Honor. Honor in work. Honor\n",
      "in morality. Honor in principle and family. Our rules are harsh, but LYSANDER obey them\n",
      "from Gold to Red. Romulus eliminated the rigged quotas in mines and the latifundia,\n",
      "has begun to phase out the Obsidian gods, and makes each man understand he is\n",
      "part of the same body. He has replaced subjugation with participation. Given a\n",
      "reason to sacrifice for the betterment of all. And it starts with us at this table, the\n",

      "nursing the question, waiting for a pause in the conversation. The timing is\n",
      "awkward.\n",

      "His daughter murdered LYSANDER friends at the Triumph.”\n",
      "  “What of you, Castor?” Dido asks. “Don’t you want revenge for your family?”\n",

      "chair, and putting Darrow and his rabid wolves in chains? LYSANDER always thought it a\n",
      "fantasy, something that could never be. But now that LYSANDER see how much strength is left\n",
      "in Gold, how much of the old virtues, it grows harder to see it as the vain, idle fantasy\n",
      "of a little boy any longer.\n",
      "  Gold is not dead.\n",
      "  “Is that why you want war?” Cassius asks. “For revenge?”\n",
      "  “In part, yes,” Dido replies. “To avenge the wrongs the Slave King has done us. But\n",
      "also to heal the chaos that he has made. His Republic has had ten years to create\n",
      "peace. They’ve failed. The time is right for the Society to be rebuilt. We have the will,\n",
      "the might. But LYSANDER need the spark. That is why LYSANDER sent LYSANDER daughter to the Gulf. To\n",
      "retrieve that spark. Thanks in no small part to you, she brought it home.” She pauses\n",
      "a moment to smile with no kindness in her eyes. “But now, LYSANDER fear it is missing.”\n",
      "  Finally, the twist. The reason behind all these innuendos and games.\n",

      "  “Oh yes, LYSANDER goodman.”\n",
      "  “That’s why you went back into the Vindabona…” LYSANDER say to Seraphina. “But you\n",

      "  “I brought your razor,” she says.\n",
      "  My heart sinks in LYSANDER chest. LYSANDER missed it. I’ve walked straight into their trap. They’ve\n",

      "  “It was lost,” LYSANDER say.\n",

      "I think it is time for dessert.” She motions to the servants and the door to the room\n",
      "opens. Two Obsidians with bulging pale arms enter carrying a load between them,\n",

      "   “If you are so thorough, then you know what sort of\n",

      "might hold our damnation in our family rings, but it also\n",
      "is our only leverage. It can’t be lost. “It is a halcon-7. It\n",

      "impervious to electronic incursion. More importantly, it\n",

      "  Cassius bends back. Too slow. The whip slices a chunk of scalp off the front of his\n",
      "forehead. Blood sheets down his face. Bellerephon uses his momentum to spin with his\n",

      "incredibly swift blows. It reminds LYSANDER more of Darrow than Aja or Cassius.\n",
      "   Blinking the blood out of his eyes, Cassius falls back under the onslaught, bending and\n",
      "circling and deflecting as the ground sparks from the metal whip. His own whip is useless\n",
      "against the longer reach of Bellerephon’s, so he uses it in rigid form for defense and relies\n",

      "  The two men part, their world tiny and furious. Their bodies tell them to flee the metal\n",
      "and break out of the horrible confines of the circle, but their minds tether them together\n",

      "into the stands, where it spatters the face of a young child three rows back. LYSANDER can’t even tell\n",
      "which man is wounded until Cassius stumbles away, a flap of skin and muscle folding over\n",
      "a long laceration all the way to the bone of his left shoulder. Blood pours out. Bellerephon\n",

      "\fthen cuts diagonally at Bellerephon’s right arm, which holds the hasta. His diamond-hard\n",
      "blade cleaves through the bone of the man’s arm like it’s pudding. An open artery sprays a\n",
      "single spurt of blood two meters long. Cassius spins with his momentum, and cuts in the\n",
      "other direction. The metal severs Bellerephon’s remaining arm at the forearm.\n",
      "  Both limbs spin to the floor. Bellerephon totters, looking at the weeping red stumps and\n",
